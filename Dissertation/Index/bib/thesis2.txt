   abstract = {Overexploitation and climate change are increasingly causing unanticipated changes in marine ecosystems, such as higher variability in fish recruitment and shifts in species dominance. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries attempts to address these effects by integrating populations, food webs and fish habitats at different scales. Ecosystem models represent indispensable tools to achieve this objective. However, a balanced research strategy is needed to avoid overly complex models. Ecosystem oceanography represents such a balanced strategy that relates ecosystem components and their interactions to climate change and exploitation. It aims at developing realistic and robust models at different levels of organisation and addressing specific questions in a global change context while systematically exploring the ever-increasing amount of biological and environmental data.},

   abstract = {We quantify the trophic positions of subtropical open-ocean zooplankton species using amino acid-specific (AA) stable nitrogen isotopic compositions. We model animal trophic position by computing trophic ¹⁵N enrichment of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine, and find that trophic position for primary copepod consumers (Oithona spp., Neocalanus robustior) and secondary copepod consumers (Pleuromamma xiphias and Euchaeta rimana) varied little over a 5-10-yr period in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG; mean ± SD: 2.1 ±0.1 and 2.9 ±0.1, respectively). Comparison of AA ¹⁵N enrichment patterns in different copepod species suggests that trophic ¹⁵N enrichment is most consistent in glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and alanine, "trophic" AAs that are intimately involved in the citric acid cycle and energy production. We further test equations involving these trophic AAs and "source" AAs (which appear to retain the nitrogen isotopic composition of the food-web base), and find that such compound-specific models give results that are identical to those calculated using whole-animal (bulk) stable isotopic compositions. However the benefits of our AA-based approach (i.e., the relatively few samples needed for precise TP estimation, elimination of the need for concurrent prey isotopic analyses, and the ability to utilize formalin-preserved specimens from archived collections), make this a powerful technique for the quantitative assessment of trophic position within the pelagic food web. We further discuss how stable isotopic analyses provide a new perspective on the structure of open-ocean food webs and can be used to trace large seasonal fluctuations in nitrogen source in the NPSG.},

Commonly voiced concerns include complicated and expensive implementation, prohibitive data requirements, and lack of testing with long-term applications. We address some of these perceived barriers by providing guidance on strategies and approaches that can be used for the steps of one ecosystem-based management process, the integrated ecosystem assessment framework, including scoping, defining indicators, setting thresholds, risk analysis, management strategy evaluation, monitoring and evaluation. Importantly, we demonstrate how an ecosystem-based management approach can be utilized in a variety of contexts which vary widely in data quality and availability, governance structure, and time frame. We then illustrate the suggested steps in the process by exploring two case studies that represent realistic ends of the data/governance/time frame spectrum: Puget Sound, Washington, USA and Raja Ampat, Indonesia. By providing concrete suggestions for how to move forward with key steps in an integrated management process, we show that ecosystem-based management is feasible from a range of starting points and that for any given starting point there are numerous productive paths forward.},

   abstract = {Phytoplankton are at the base of aquatic food webs and of global importance for ecosystem functioning and services. The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

   pages = {45-55},
   abstract = {We used primary productivity data derived from remote sensing images and catch data for the period 1998 to 2004 to characterize the productivity of eco-regions in the northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean, Black and Baltic Seas, and then analyzed the strength of the trophic linkage between primary productivity and marine fisheries production in European seas. Mean annual primary production (PP) derived from an ocean-color based model was highly contrasted among eco-regions, exceeding 500 g C m yr in the Marmara and North Seas but being less than 150 g C m yr in the Faroes, Adriatic-Ionian and Aegean-Levantine Seas. Fisheries production expressed in mean annual yield and primary production required to support catches (PPR) varied greatly among eco-regions, from 0.02 t km and 0.7 g C m yr for the oceanic northeast Atlantic eco-region to 6 t km and 130 g C m yr in the Marmara Sea respectively. Linear regression models showed significant positive relationships between PP and yield as well as between PP and PPR, suggesting a strong linkage between marine productivity and fisheries production in European seas. Moreover, this bottom-up control appeared consistent over time: recent mean annual yield for the period 1998 to 2004 reflected the long-term yield averaged over the last 3 decades. We argue that such large-scale coupling is due to energy transfer along the food web (from phytoplankton to predators) through predation processes, primary productivity driving the production of living marine resources and their exploitation at the scale of eco-regions. Our findings have an important bearing for ecosystem approaches to fisheries, particularly for the estimation of the capacity of eco-regions with regard to sustainable exploitation. This is further relevant in a context of climate change, because variations in PP linked to global warming could strongly modify fisheries production in the future.},

   abstract = {The dependence of long‐term fishery yields on primary productivity, largely based on cross‐system comparisons and without reference to the potential dynamic character of this relationship, has long been considered strong evidence for bottom‐up control in marine systems. We examined time series of intensive empirical observations from nine heavily exploited regions in the western North Atlantic and find evidence of spatial variance of trophic control. Top‐down control dominated in northern areas, the dynamics evolved from bottom‐up to top‐down in an intermediate region, and bottom‐up control governed the southern areas. A simplified, trophic control diagram was developed accounting for top‐down and bottom‐up forcing within a larger region whose base state dynamics are bottom‐up and can accommodate time‐varying dynamics. Species diversity and ocean temperature co‐varied, being relatively high in southern areas and lower in the north, mirroring the shifting pattern of trophic control. A combination of compensatory population dynamics and accelerated demographic rates in southern areas seems to account for the greater stability of the predator species complex in this region.},

While data collected by these surveys have provided valuable information on long-term variability in plankton populations, all previous analyses have been limited to only a portion of the geographic range of the available data. Here we present an analysis of the CPR data from the Mid Atlantic Bight to the Labrador Sea. Across this wide geographic range, we found many common associations among the taxa. In particular, the changes in most regions were strongly size structured, with small and medium copepods varying together and often positively related to indicators of phytoplankton abundance. The time series from nearby regions were strongly correlated; however, after 1990, the spatial pattern became more complex. During this period, several of the copepod taxa, noticeably Calanus finmarchicus and Centropages typicus, experienced a series of anomalies that appeared to propagate from northeast to southwest. Although the direction of propagation was consistent with the shelf circulation, the anomalies propagated at a rate much slower than typical current speeds. The timing of the copepod anomalies and their phase speed were similar in character to observed changes in salinity and the position of the Shelf Slope Front. The correspondence between the changes in the plankton community and changes in the physical environmental suggests that physical conditions are a strong driver of interannual variability in Northwest Atlantic Shelf ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were used to track energy flow and nutrient cycling pathways in the plankton food web of a subarctic Alaskan lake. Results indicated that planktonic primary production was the major energy source fueling the zooplankton community. In spring, δ 15 N of Daphnia was strongly influenced by atmospheric nitrogen derived from a N 2 -fixing blue-green algal bloom. In winter, δ 13 C evidence suggested that phytoplankton comprised a small fraction (~15%) of particulate organic matter (POM) in the water column, largely due to low primary productivity. The disparity between δ 13 C of POM and Daphnia in winter may result from preferential assimilation of isotopically light algal carbon from POM. Nitrogen isotope values showed that Heterocope, a presumed carnivore, probably relied heavily on POM as a nutrient source. In common with some arctic lakes, the δ 15 N data showed less than three trophic levels in this plankton food web. The energy transfer pathways and trophic levels revealed a simple plankton trophic structure in this subarctic lacustrine system.},

Annual averages of the δ15N of plankton (C, LT, E > D, H > POM) matched expected differences in trophic position, but seasonal patterns differed among species. During midsummer, the δ15N of D, H, and LT increased above the δ15N of E and C, despite little temporal or spatial variation in the δ15N of POM (<41 µm). Larger size fractions of POM (41-200 µm) helped explain some of the temporal variability of zooplankton δ15N. Body size of zooplankton was correlated with δ15N for D, C, and E, which could indicate size-based, trophic-level variation; selective feeding; or physiological differences in 15N enrichment. We propose that detailed time series of δ15N for multiple zooplankton species can help determine the seasonal variability of trophic structure in zooplankton assemblages.Nous avons mesuré les δ15N de la matière organique particulaire (POM), de Daphnia pulex (D), d'Holopedium gibberum (H), de Leptodiaptomus tyrelli (LT), d'Epischura nevadensis (E) et de Chaoborus trivittatus (C) durant un cycle annuel au lac Council, un lac oligotrophe non perturbé et sans poissons. Les valeurs moyennes annuelles de δ15N du plancton (C, LT, E > D, H > POM) correspondent aux différences attendues, compte tenu des positions trophiques, mais les patrons saisonniers varient d'une espèce à l'autre. Durant la mi-été, les δ15N de D, H et LT dépassent les δ15N de E et C, malgré le peu de variation temporelle ou spatiale du δ15N de POM (<41 µm). Les fractions de plus grande taille de POM (41-200 µm) aident à expliquer une partie de la variabilité temporelle du δ15N du plancton. Il y a une corrélation entre la taille corporelle du zooplancton et le δ15N chez D, C et E, ce qui pourrait indiquer une variation du niveau trophique, une alimentation sélective ou des différences physiologiques dans l'enrichissement en δ15N en fonction de la taille. Nous croyons que des séries chronologiques détaillées de δ15N pour plusieurs espèces du zooplancton pourraient aider à déterminer la variabilité saisonnière de la structure trophique des peuplements de zooplancton.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

In this study, the δ15N of 16 amino acids in marine planktonic consumers and their food sources were examined using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry of their N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester derivatives. Moderate increases in bulk δ15N with trophic position reflect an averaging of large increases in the δ15N of some amino acids, and little or no change in others. Amino acids showing consistently large increases (e.g., glutamic acid changes by ~7‰ between food and consumer) provide greater scope for defining trophic position than the smaller isotopic changes in bulk material. In contrast, amino acids like phenylalanine show no change in δ15 N with trophic position and therefore preserve information about nitrogen sources at the base of the food web. The ability to acquire information about both trophic level and nitrogen sources at the base of the food web from single samples of consumer tissues offers a powerful new tool for elucidating pathways of N transfer through food webs.},

   abstract = {Periphyton is an important component within the littoral zones of lakes, but it is known to vary dramatically on small (cm–m) and large (km) spatial scales, showing differences in composition and abundance. Until relatively recently, changes in periphyton composition along depth gradients have not been studied sufficiently and the response of small meiobenthic invertebrates inhabiting the periphyton to vertically changing environmental conditions such as light are poorly understood. To investigate the changing community composition of epilithic (on stones) nematodes along a depth gradient, we conducted a field study at Lake Erken, Sweden, with the specific objective to investigate whether changes in periphyton composition (algae, bacteria) are reflected in changing nematode feeding types and what the consequences are for nematodes and their resource consumption. We analysed the abundance, species composition and feeding type distribution of epilithic nematodes along 11 depth levels, from 5 to 300 cm water depth. Our study resulted in the first measurements of carbon ( 13 C) and nitrogen ( 15 N) stable isotopes in free living nematodes in lakes. Nematode community composition and feeding type distribution exhibited dramatic changes along the depth gradient. Nematode feeding types changed from a dominance of algae-feeding species in the shallow littoral zone to one of bacteria-feeding species in the deep littoral zone. The 13 C stable isotope signatures of nematodes and the small (<20 μm) periphyton fraction changed with increasing depth, with nematodes shown to feed on this small periphytic component. Nematodes were identified as primary consumers by means of trophic level calculations based on 15 N stable isotopes.},

   abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotope signatures (δ 15N) are increasingly used to infer the trophic position of consumers in food web studies. Interpreting the δ 15N of consumers relative to the δ 15N characterizing the base of the food web provides a time-integrated measure of trophic position. We use primary consumers (trophic level 2) as baseline indicator organisms and investigate the variation in baseline δ 15N values in 14 lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Values of δ 15N ranged from -2 to +9%o and varied significantly as a function of lake habitat (mean littoral = 1.6%o, pelagic = 3.1%o, profundal= 5.2%o).. Stable carbon isotopic signatures (δ 13C) of primary consumers decreased along this same habitat gradient (mean littoral = -23.8%o, pelagic = -28.4%o, profundal = -30.5%o). Primary consumer δ 13C and a categorical lake variable explained 72% of the variability in primary consumer δ 15N. This relationship was corroborated by primary consumer δ 15N and δ 13C data from the literature, indicating that habitat-specific variation in baseline δ 15N and δ 13C is a widespread phenomenon in freshwater systems. We present a method that uses the presented baseline δ 15N-δ 13C relationship and the δ 15N and δ 13C values of the consumer to estimate trophic position; it is a method that corrects for the described variation in baseline δ 15N.

   abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotope ratios of whole organisms and tissues are routinely used in studies of trophic relationships and nitrogen flow through ecosystems, yet changes underlying increases in δ15N from food source to consumer are not completely understood. In this study, the δ15N of 16 amino acids in marine planktonic consumers and their food sources were examined using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry of their N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester derivatives. Moderate increases in bulk δ15N with trophic position reflect an averaging of large increases in the δ15N of some amino acids, and little or no change in others. Amino acids showing consistently large increases (e.g., glutamic acid changes by ~7‰ between food and consumer) provide greater scope for defining trophic position than the smaller isotopic changes in bulk material. In contrast, amino acids like phenylalanine show no change in δ15 N with trophic position and therefore preserve information about nitrogen sources at the base of the food web. The ability to acquire information about both trophic level and nitrogen sources at the base of the food web from single samples of consumer tissues offers a powerful new tool for elucidating pathways of N transfer through food webs.},

   abstract = {Periphyton is an important component within the littoral zones of lakes, but it is known to vary dramatically on small (cm–m) and large (km) spatial scales, showing differences in composition and abundance. Until relatively recently, changes in periphyton composition along depth gradients have not been studied sufficiently and the response of small meiobenthic invertebrates inhabiting the periphyton to vertically changing environmental conditions such as light are poorly understood. To investigate the changing community composition of epilithic (on stones) nematodes along a depth gradient, we conducted a field study at Lake Erken, Sweden, with the specific objective to investigate whether changes in periphyton composition (algae, bacteria) are reflected in changing nematode feeding types and what the consequences are for nematodes and their resource consumption. We analysed the abundance, species composition and feeding type distribution of epilithic nematodes along 11 depth levels, from 5 to 300 cm water depth. Our study resulted in the first measurements of carbon ( 13 C) and nitrogen ( 15 N) stable isotopes in free living nematodes in lakes. Nematode community composition and feeding type distribution exhibited dramatic changes along the depth gradient. Nematode feeding types changed from a dominance of algae-feeding species in the shallow littoral zone to one of bacteria-feeding species in the deep littoral zone. The 13 C stable isotope signatures of nematodes and the small (<20 μm) periphyton fraction changed with increasing depth, with nematodes shown to feed on this small periphytic component. Nematodes were identified as primary consumers by means of trophic level calculations based on 15 N stable isotopes.},

We use primary consumers (trophic level 2) as baseline indicator organisms and investigate the variation in baseline δ 15N values in 14 lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Values of δ 15N ranged from -2 to +9%o and varied significantly as a function of lake habitat (mean littoral = 1.6%o, pelagic = 3.1%o, profundal= 5.2%o).. Stable carbon isotopic signatures (δ 13C) of primary consumers decreased along this same habitat gradient (mean littoral = -23.8%o, pelagic = -28.4%o, profundal = -30.5%o).

   abstract = {Pulsed resource subsidies can have ecological effects that persist over time. These subsidies can be particularly important in aquatic ecosystems, which are often resource-limited. Anadromous salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) deliver annual nutrient pulses to many freshwater ecosystems around the North Pacific. The persistent ecological consequences of this nutrient subsidy are poorly understood across the range of Pacific salmon and likely depend on stream habitat, background nutrient dynamics, and the abundance of spawning salmon. Using a model selection approach, we examined relationships among spawning salmon density, stream habitats, and the abundance and diversity of stream invertebrates ten months after salmon spawning, across 21 streams in central British Columbia, Canada. Total invertebrate abundance increased with salmon density and with higher stream temperatures. Invertebrate diversity was more closely related to stream habitat characteristics than to salmon density. These results suggest that salmon nutrients have a greater impact on stream invertebrate population sizes than on the variety of taxa that inhabit these streams. The three most common invertebrate families-grazing mayflies (Heptageniidae), predatory stoneflies (Chloroperlidae), and chironomid midges (Chironomidae)-all increased in abundance with salmon density. Stream habitat variables (temperature, pH, and substrate size) also explained significant variation in the abundances of the three groups. These results suggest that salmon nutrients retained in the watershed from previous years help support greater abundances of some invertebrate taxa. Thus the pulsed nutrient subsidy provided by spawning salmon may have ecological effects that persist many months, or even years, after it is delivered.},

   abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids (δ15NAA) has recently been employed as a powerful tool in ecological food web studies, particularly for estimating the trophic position (TP) of animal species in food webs. However, the validity of these estimates depends on the consistency of the trophic discrimination factor (TDF; = Δδ15NAA at each shift of trophic level) among a suite of amino acids within the tissues of consumer species. In this study, we determined the TDF values of amino acids in tadpoles (the Japanese toad, Bufo japonicus) reared exclusively on one of three diets that differed in nutritional quality. The diets were commercial fish‐food pellets (plant and animal biomass), bloodworms (animal biomass), and boiled white rice (plant carbohydrate), representing a balanced, protein‐rich, and protein‐poor diet, respectively. The TDF values of two “source amino acids” (Src‐AAs), methionine and phenylalanine, were close to zero (0.3–0.5‰) among the three diets, typifying the values reported in the literature (~0.5‰ and ~0.4‰, respectively). However, TDF values of “trophic amino acids” (Tr‐AAs) including alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and glutamic acid varied by diet: for example, the glutamic acid TDF was similar to the standard value (~8.0‰) when tadpoles were fed either the commercial pellets (8.0‰) or bloodworms (7.9‰), but when they were fed boiled rice, the TDF was significantly reduced (0.6‰). These results suggest that a profound lack of dietary protein may alter the TDF values of glutamic acid (and other Tr‐AAs and glycine) within consumer species, but not the two Src‐AAs (i.e., methionine and phenylalanine). Knowledge of how a nutritionally poor diet can influence the TDF of Tr‐ and Src‐AAs will allow amino acid isotopic analyses to better estimate TP among free‐roaming animals. Diet quality influences the trophic discrimination of stable nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids in an aquatic vertebrate, although the isotopic composition has been employed as a powerful tool in ecological food web studies particularly for estimating the trophic position of animal species in food webs. Knowledge of how a nutritionally poor diet can influence the isotopic discrimination of amino acids will allow amino acid isotopic analyses to better estimate trophic position among free‐roaming animals.},

   abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models are increasingly used to quantify consumer diets, but may be misused and misinterpreted. We address major challenges to their effective application. Mixing models have increased rapidly in sophistication. Current models estimate probability distributions of source contributions, have user-friendly interfaces, and incorporate complexities such as variability in isotope signatures, discrimination factors, hierarchical variance structure, covariates, and concentration dependence. For proper implementation of mixing models, we offer the following suggestions. First, mixing models can only be as good as the study and data. Studies should have clear questions, be informed by knowledge of the system, and have strong sampling designs to effectively characterize isotope variability of consumers and resources on proper spatio-temporal scales. Second, studies should use models appropriate for the question and recognize their assumptions and limitations. Decisions about source grouping or incorporation of concentration dependence can influence results. Third, studies should be careful about interpretation of model outputs. Mixing models generally estimate proportions of assimilated resources with substantial uncertainty distributions. Last, common sense, such as graphing data before analyzing, is essential to maximize usefulness of these tools. We hope these suggestions for effective implementation of stable isotope mixing models will aid continued development and application of this field.},

   abstract = {Compound‐specific stable isotope analysis of individual amino acids (CSIA‐AA) has emerged as a transformative approach to estimate consumer trophic positions (TPCSIA) that are internally indexed to primary producer nitrogen isotope baselines. Central to accurate TPCSIA estimation is an understanding of beta (β) values—the differences between trophic and source AA δ15N values in the primary producers at the base of a consumers’ food web. Growing evidence suggests higher taxonomic and tissue‐specific β value variability than typically appreciated. This meta‐analysis fulfils a pressing need to comprehensively evaluate relevant sources of β value variability and its contribution to TPCSIA uncertainty. We first synthesized all published primary producer AA δ15N data to investigate ecologically relevant sources of variability (e.g. taxonomy, tissue type, habitat type, mode of photosynthesis). We then reviewed the biogeochemical mechanisms underpinning AA δ15N and β value variability. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivity of TPCSIA estimates to uncertainty in mean βGlx‐Phe values and Glx‐Phe trophic discrimination factors (TDFGlx‐Phe). We show that variation in βGlx‐Phe values is two times greater than previously considered, with degree of vascularization, not habitat type (terrestrial vs. aquatic), providing the greatest source of variability (vascular autotroph = −6.6 ± 3.4‰; non‐vascular autotroph = +3.3 ± 1.8‰). Within vascular plants, tissue type secondarily contributed to βGlx‐Phe value variability, but we found no clear distinction among C3, C4 and CAM plant βGlx‐Phe values. Notably, we found that vascular plant βGlx‐Lys values (+2.5 ± 1.6‰) are considerably less variable than βGlx‐Phe values, making Lys a useful AA tracer of primary production sources in terrestrial systems. Our multi‐trophic level sensitivity analyses demonstrate that TPCSIA estimates are highly sensitive to changes in both βGlx‐Phe and TDFGlx‐Phe values but that the relative influence of β values dissipates at higher trophic levels. Our results highlight that primary producer β values are integral to accurate trophic position estimation. We outline four key recommendations for identifying, constraining and accounting for β value variability to improve TPCSIA estimation accuracy and precision moving forward. We must ultimately expand libraries of primary producer AA δ15N values to better understand the mechanistic drivers of β value variation.},

   abstract = {Abstract Intraspecific and interspecific variation in the trophic position of various consumers is central to many theories of aquatic ecosystem functioning and dynamics. In recent years, such issues have been addressed using stable N isotopes (δ15N) to estimate trophic position of consumers in aquatic ecosystems. However, one needs to correct for variation in baseline δ15N among sites to estimate the trophic position of any aquatic consumer using δ15N. We first discuss the steps needed to select a baseline indicator in river ecosystems, where abundant foodweb isotopic data have been published but limited attention has been paid to identification of baseline organisms. We examined within-site differences in δ15N among primary consumers belonging to different functional and taxonomic groups and found significant differences in δ15N. Collectors were significantly enriched compared to other primary consumers. We propose scrapers as a baseline δ15N indicator because they showed low δ15N values and were more w...},

   abstract = {Copepod feeding rates and food selectivity were measured at an oceanic subantarctic site over 5 d in February 1994. A series of gut fluorescence and gut evacuation experiments was carried out for species ranging in size from Oithona similis to Pleuromamma robusta. The copepods were also incubated in ambient seawater to compare their clearance rates on ciliates, diatoms and total chlorophyll a (chl a), using microscope counts and chlorophyll budgets. Mesozooplankton were concentrated into the top 50 m layer where biomass was high (5.5 g dry mass m−2) and comprised mainly (65%) of copepods. Copepod biomass was dominated by copepodite CV of Calanus simillimus. Numerically, however, Oithona spp. (mainly O. similis) constituted 85% of the copepods. These 2 species dominated copepod grazing and contributed to community grazing in about equal proportions. Chl a concentrations were low (∼0.7 mg m−3) and were comprised of mostly nano- and picoplankton. Low daily phytoplankton carbon rations were derived from the 2 methods which measured total chl a consumption. These ranged from 1.5% (CVI♀ C. simillimus) to 34 % of body carbon (late stage copepodites of Oithona spp.) These values were generally well below their estimated respiratory requirements, and probably reflected phytoplankton shortage because clearance rates were fairly high. Clearance rates for total chl a in the incubations tended to be less than those for the counted taxa > 10 μm, suggesting that some of the chl a was in cells too small to be eaten. Feeding selectivity followed a similar pattern across the 4 incubations. Highest clearance rates were on ciliates (∼15 μm), dinoflagellates (∼20 μm) or the diatom Corethron sp. (∼200 μm). Ciliates and dinoflagellates were cleared faster than centric diatoms of similar overall dimensions. It is suggested that the copepods were preying on protozoans preferentially, in response to phytoplankton shortage. Allometric relationships were used to derive the grazing and predation impact of the whole copepod community on primary production and estimated ciliate production. Less than 4% of primary production was removed per day. Copepod predation on ciliates was higher: 57% of daily production, assuming a net growth rate for ciliates of 0.1 d−1.},

   abstract = {Wind-driven coastal ocean upwelling supplies nutrients to the euphotic zone near the coast. Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2°C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50% and 30% less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83% and 66%, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions.},

   title = {Are you what you eat? Effects of trophic discrimination factors on estimates of food assimilation and trophic position with a new estimation method},
   journal = {Ecological indicators},
   volume = {75},
   pages = {234-241},
   abstract = {•A new method to estimate trophic position of omnivores is proposed.•The method is based on the differential trophic discrimination of each source.•Mixing models results are used to construct the trophic discrimination factor.•The new method reflected the differential assimilation of plant and animal sources. A key factor for estimates of assimilation of resources and trophic position based on stable isotope data is the trophic discrimination factor (TDF). TDFs are assumed based on literature reviews, but may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type of diet. We analyzed effects of alternative TDFs on estimates of assimilated resources and trophic positions for an omnivorous fish, Jenynsia multidentata, that reveals dietary variation among locations across a salinity gradient of a coastal lagoon in southern Brazil. We also compared estimates of foods ingested vs. foods assimilated. Food assimilation was estimated using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios of food sources and consumer muscle tissue and an isotopic mixing model (SIAR); consumer trophic position (TP) was estimated from consumer and production source δ15N values. Diet was estimated using an index of relative importance based on frequency of occurrence and volumetric and numeric proportions of food items from stomach contents. The effect of variation in TDF on food assimilation and TP was tested using three alternative TDFs reported in review papers. We then created a new method that used food source-specific TDFs (reported separately for herbivores and carnivores) weighted in proportion to estimated assimilation of resources according to mixing model estimates to estimate TP (hereafter TPWAR). We found that plant material was not assimilated in a proportion similar to its importance in the diet of fish at a freshwater site, and the new method yielded best assimilation estimates. Animal material made greatest contributions to fish biomass irrespective of TDFs used in the mixing model. The new method produced TP estimates consistent with differences in estimated food assimilation along the salinity gradient. Our findings support the idea that food source-specific TDFs should be used in trophic studies of omnivores, since the method improved our ability to estimate trophic position and resource assimilation, two important ecological indicators.},

   abstract = {Resource subsidies affect nutrient cycling, species interactions, and food webs in ways that influence ecosystem structure and function, but their effects depend on the history, magnitude, and recurrence frequency of the subsidies. In aquatic ecosystems, plant detritus has been considered the predominant form of such subsidies; however, while considered less abundant in many ecosystems, carrion represents subsidies with relatively rapid turnover and highly concentrated nutrient and energy release that can have strong and lasting effects on ecosystems. Carrion subsidies can be both autochthonous or allochthonous, and come in the form of natural senescence or disease-related non-consumptive mortality, phenology-based programed death (e.g., salmon spawning and death), or stochastic and episodic events (e.g., mass fish die-offs). All aquatic ecosystems have some level of non-consumptive mortality that provides a background level of carcasses to aquatic ecosystems, while others have a natural history of carrion resource subsidies (e.g., natural salmon-bearing streams), and some have only recently been exposed to phenology-based carrion subsidies (e.g., anthropogenic salmon introductions around the world). Many aquatic ecosystems experience episodic subsidies in the form of unexpected mass mortalities (e.g., eutrophication-, disease-, or climate-related mass die-offs) or have seasonally dependent pulses, like that of marine or lake snow in the form of zooplankton carcasses. The responses of ecosystems to these different histories and frequencies of carrion subsidies have often been independently investigated, with little effort to compare and bridge research boundaries in the broader context of resource subsidies. In this review, we provide a synthesis of how pulsed carrion nutrient and energy subsidies have widespread and lasting impacts on many aquatic ecosystems. We do this with a synthesis of literature from freshwater and marine ecosystems along three themes of how carrion is produced and decomposes: autochthonous and allochthonous necromass; phenology-based mortality; and stochastic and episodic mass mortality subsidies. Studies of charismatic megafauna carrion (e.g., whales) have described significant impacts in deep ocean systems, but much less is understood for other groups of animals. Quantifying the energy, nutrient, and foodweb effects of carrion is needed for more species and among habitats to more fully understand how ubiquitous forms of necromass contribute to aquatic ecosystem structure and function.},

Yet compound-specific trophic discrimination factors have not been estimated for a broad range of habitats, taxa, and diets.

We also compared TDF AA of fish muscle and scale to evaluate the viability of scales for making food web inferences. Mean ± 1 SD TDF Bulk was 2.2‰ ± 0.9‰, and there were significant effects of species and diet trophic position on TDF Bulk . Mean ± 1 SD TDF AA was 6.9‰ ± 0.8‰. Although there was no effect of species on TDF AA , there were significant differences in TDF AA across the three diets. TDF AA from fish scales were not significantly different from those of muscle. Our study illustrates the advantages of estimating trophic position using compound-specific stable isotopes and the need for continued investigation of factors resulting in variation in TDF values.},

   abstract = {Stable isotopes are now used widely in ecological studies, including diet reconstruction, where quantitative inferences about diet composition are derived from the use of mixing models. Recent Bayesian models (MixSIR, SIAR) allow users to incorporate variability in discrimination factors (ΔΔ 13 C or ΔΔ 15 N), or the amount of change in either δδ 13 C or δδ 15 N between prey and consumer, but to date there has been no systematic assessment of the effect of variation in ΔΔ 13 C or ΔΔ 15 N on model outputs. We used whole blood from Common Terns ( Sterna hirundo ) and muscle from their common prey items (fish and euphausiids) to build a series of mixing models in SIAR (stable isotope analysis in R) using various discrimination factors from the published literature for marine birds. The estimated proportion of each diet component was affected significantly by ΔΔ 13 C or ΔΔ 15 N. We also use recently published stable-isotope data on the reliance of critically endangered Balearic Shearwaters ( Puffinus mauretanicus ) on fisheries discards to show that discrimination factor choice can have profound implications for conservation and management actions. It is therefore crucial for researchers wishing to use mixing models to have an accurate estimate of ΔΔ 13 C and ΔΔ 15 N, because quantitative diet estimates can help to direct future research or prioritize conservation and management actions.},

   abstract = {Compound specific isotopic analysis (CSIA) of amino acids has received increasing attention in ecological studies in recent years due to its ability to evaluate trophic positions and elucidate baseline nutrient sources. However, the incorporation rates of individual amino acids into protein and specific trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) are largely unknown, limiting the application of CSIA to trophic studies. We determined nitrogen turnover rates of individual amino acids from a long-term (up to 1054 days) laboratory experiment using captive Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis (PBFT), a large endothermic pelagic fish fed a controlled diet. Small PBFT (white muscle δ(15)N∼11.5‰) were collected in San Diego, CA and transported to the Tuna Research and Conservation Center (TRCC) where they were fed a controlled diet with high δ(15)N values relative to PBFT white muscle (diet δ(15)N∼13.9‰). Half-lives of trophic and source amino acids ranged from 28.6 to 305.4 days and 67.5 to 136.2 days, respectively. The TDF for the weighted mean values of amino acids was 3.0 ‰, ranging from 2.2 to 15.8 ‰ for individual combinations of 6 trophic and 5 source amino acids. Changes in the δ(15)N values of amino acids across trophic levels are the underlying drivers of the trophic (15)N enrichment. Nearly all amino acid δ(15)N values in this experiment changed exponentially and could be described by a single compartment model. Significant differences in the rate of (15)N incorporation were found for source and trophic amino acids both within and between these groups. Varying half-lives of individual amino acids can be applied to migratory organisms as isotopic clocks, determining the length of time an individual has spent in a new environment. These results greatly enhance the ability to interpret compound specific isotope analyses in trophic studies.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have shown the utility of $\delta ^{15}$N to model trophic structure and contaminant bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. However, cross-system comparisons in $\delta ^{15}$N can be complicated by differences in $\delta ^{15}$N at the base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in $\delta ^{15}$N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the $\delta ^{15}$N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that $\delta ^{15}$N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in $\delta ^{15}$N likely reflects the high $\delta ^{15}$N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in $\delta ^{15}$N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that the $\delta ^{15}$N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the food chain will provide a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.},

   abstract = {Species invasions pose a serious threat to biodiversity and native ecosystems; however, predicting and quantifying the impacts of invasive species has proven problematic. Here we use stable isotope ratios to document the food-web consequences of the invasion of two non-native predators, smallmouth bass and rock bass, into Canadian lakes. Invaded lakes had lower littoral prey-fish diversity and abundance than uninvaded reference lakes. Consistent with this difference, lake trout from invaded lakes had more negative δ13C values (-29.2‰ versus -27.4‰) and reduced trophic positions (3.3 versus 3.9) than those from reference lakes, indicating differences in food-web structure. Furthermore, a comparison of the pre- and post-invasion food webs of two recently invaded lakes showed that invasion was followed by substantial declines in littoral prey-fish abundance and the trophic position of lake trout, reflecting a shift in the diet of lake trout towards zooplankton and reduced dependence on littoral fish. This study demonstrates the use of stable isotope techniques to detect changes in food-web structure following perturbations; in this instance, bass-induced food-web shifts may have severe consequences for native species and ecosystems.},

Our aim was to examine how the feeding rates and prey selection of these three copepod stages respond to concomitant changes in microplankton community composition and prey abundance. Copepods typically ingested prey overall according to its ambient concentration although significant species and stage-specific differences in prey-type ingestion and selection were apparent. Despite being of comparable weight, the ingestion rates of C. finmarchicus nauplii were always higher than those of the O. similis females. Moreover, C. finmarchicus nauplii and O. similis females fed preferentially on diatoms and ciliates respectively, whereas adult female C. finmarchicus showed limited prey selectivity. Copepod grazing impact on total and on ciliates/dinoflagellates standing stock was <0.5 and <2%, respectively. We attribute this result to a combination of low grazing rates, low copepod abundance and low microplankton biomass, all of which are indicative of the non-bloom conditions under which these experiments were conducted. The differences in copepod feeding rates and prey selection we report reflect species and stage-specific eco-physiological adaptations, which may act as important driving forces for marine ecosystem structuring and functioning.},

   abstract = {Isotopic models are increasingly used to determine the relative contribution of different food sources to an animal's diet. However, these models are based on restrictive assumptions and provide estimates rather than exact values of contributions to consumer diet. The sources of inaccuracies in isotopic models are not well understood and laboratory experiments may be useful to evaluate model performance. In this paper we assess the accuracy of the three main isotopic models in controlled laboratory experiments, involving a breed of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769)), in which the isotopic values of resources are known. At the same time, we measure errors resulting from the use of fixed or specific discrimination factor values for each resource and tissue. We show that the results of the three main isotopic models deviate considerably from the correct values in some cases. Estimations obtained using specific discrimination factors (corresponding to each experimental diet and tissue) were more accurate than those obtained using fixed discrimination factors (obtained from the literature). In addition, estimations varied depending on the tissue used, with the liver giving more accurate results than muscle or hair. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of isotopic models and highlight the importance of taking these assumptions into account when the most accurate results are sought. Finally, we propose some recommendations for the correct use of isotopic models, emphasizing the need to use specific discrimination factors for each species, tissue, and diet isotopic value.On utilise de plus en plus fréquemment des modèles isotopiques pour déterminer les contributions relatives des différentes sources de nourriture au régime alimentaire des animaux. Ces modèles sont, cependant, basés sur des présuppositions restrictives et ils fournissent des estimations plutôt que des valeurs exactes des contributions au régime du consommateur. On connaît mal les sources des imprécisions dans les modèles isotopiques; des expériences en laboratoire peuvent donc être utiles pour évaluer la performance de ces modèles. Dans notre étude, nous évaluons la précision de trois modèles isotopiques courants dans des expériences contrôlées en laboratoire avec une race de rats surmulots (Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769)), dans lesquelles les valeurs isotopiques des ressources sont connues. En même temps, nous mesurons les erreurs produites par l'utilisation de valeurs de facteurs de discrimination fixes ou spécifiques pour chaque ressource et tissu. Nous démontrons que les résultats obtenus dans les trois modèles isotopiques courants peuvent s'éloigner considérablement des valeurs réelles dans certains cas. Les estimations obtenues par l'usage de facteurs de discrimination spécifiques (correspondant à chaque régime et tissu de l'expérience) sont plus précises que celles obtenues par l'utilisation de facteurs de discrimination fixes (tirés de la littérature). De plus, les estimations varient en fonction des tissus, car le foie permet des résultats plus précis que les muscles ou les poils. Nous discutons des présuppositions et des limites des modèles isotopiques et nous insistons sur l'importance de tenir compte de ces présuppositions pour l'obtention des résultats les plus précis.

   abstract = {The reaction progress variable is applied to stable isotope turnover of biological tissues. This approach has the advantage of readily determining whether more than one isotope turnover pool is present; in addition, the normalization process inherent to the model means that multiple experiments can be considered together although the initial and final isotope compositions are different. Consideration of multiple isotope turnover pools allows calculation of diet histories of animals using a time sequence of isotope measurements along with isotope turnover pools. The delayed release of blood cells from bone marrow during a diet turnover experiment can be quantified using this approach. Turnover pools can also be corrected for increasing mass during an experiment, such as when the animals are actively growing. Previous growth models have been for exponential growth; the approach here can be used for several different growth models.},

   abstract = {Black marlin (Istiompax indica) are large, highly mobile, apex pelagic predators of tropical and subtropical oceans with high economic importance in western North Pacific fisheries. To assess the ontogenetic trophic ecology of black marlin in the western North Pacific Ocean, the stable isotopic composition of 177 black marlin muscle samples (87–383 cm, eye-orbit fork length (EFL); 33–447 kg, body weight) were examined for ontogenetic shifts and seasonal variability in trophic position. δ15N and δ13C values for black marlin ranged from 9.7 to 14.5‰ and −18.5 to −15.2‰, respectively, and δ15N values were positively correlated with size. δ15N and δ13C values varied across seasons, with highest δ15N values in autumn. Based on trophic position estimates and Bayesian mixing models, large black marlin (>250 cm EFL) occupied a higher trophic position (4.8) and fed on more mesopelagic prey (e.g. hairtail, Trichiurus lepturus) compared to smaller individuals, which were estimated to feed more on forage fish and squids as well as hairtail. These results suggest that the trophic position of black marlin varies across life-history stages and seasons, possibly reflecting seasonal movements in surrounding pelagic ecosystems. Trophic level estimates highlight the important ecological role of black marlin as a top predator in pelagic ecosystems, and indicate potential regional importance of mesopelagic fishes in diets.},

However, because this “amino acid method” has been constructed from the observations of only a few case studies of food‐consumer combinations in previous studies, the universality of the approach remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the δ15N signatures of amino acids in 17 photoautotrophs and the trophic relationships during four controlled feeding experiments using green algae, zooplankton, and fish. The results are consistent with those reported in previous studies, implying that the amino acid method can be applied to a variety of organisms. From these and previously published data, we estimate the two factors (β, isotope differences among amino acids in primary producers; Δ, the 15N‐enrichment factor for each trophic level) required to calculate the trophic level. Based on the lowest error (1σ = 0.12) in the estimated trophic level, we conclude that a comparison of the δ15N values for glutamic acid and phenylalanine is most useful in calculating precise estimates of the trophic level, using the following equation: trophic level (TLGlu/Phe) = (δ15NGlu − δ15NPhe − 3.4)/7.6 + 1.},

It discusses isotope distribution in the context of fractionation processes, thermodynamics, mass conservation, exchange kinetics, and diffusion theory, and includes more than 100 original equations. The theoretical principles are illustrated with natural examples that emphasize oxygen and hydrogen isotope variations in natural waters, terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks, and hydrothermal systems. New data on meteoric precipitation, rivers, springs, formation fluids, and hydrothermal systems are included in relation to various natural phenomena. Essentially, this book seeks to reconnect the diverse phenomenological observations of isotope distribution to the quantitative theories of physical chemistry and the language of differential equations. It may serve as a textbook for advanced students, as a research reference, or as a quick source of information. The book is organized into five chapters, each followed by suggested quantitative problems and a short reference list. The three theoretical chapters progress from an elementary review of the physical chemistry of stable isotopes, to the thermodynamics of isotopic compounds, and finally to the calculation of isotope distribution in dynamic systems. The third and fifth chapters emphasize oxygen and hydrogen isotope variations in Earth's hydrosphere and lithosphere, constituting the most important examples of the theoretical principles. Appendices provide data on atomic weights of light elements, physical constants, mathematical relationships, and isotopic fractionation factors.},

   number = {4},
   pages = {647-658},
   abstract = {Assessments of temporal variation in diets are important for our understanding of the ecology of many vertebrates. Ratios of naturally occurring stable isotopes in animal tissues are a combination of the source elements and tissue specific fractionation processes, and can thus reveal dietary information. We review three different approaches that have been used to resolve temporal diet variation through analysis of stable isotopes. The most straightforward approach is to compare samples from the same type of tissue that has been sampled over time. This approach is suited to address either long or short-term dietary variation, depending on sample regime and which tissue that is sampled. Second, one can compare tissues with different metabolic rates. Since the elements in a given tissue have been assimilating during time spans specific to its metabolic rate, tissues with different metabolic rates will reflect dietary records over different periods. Third, comparisons of sections from tissues with progressive growth, such as hair, feathers, claws and teeth, will reveal temporal variation since these tissues will retain isotopic values in a chronological order. These latter two approaches are mainly suited to address questions regarding intermediate and short-term dietary variation. Knowledge of tissue specific metabolic rates, which determine the molecular turnover for a specific tissue, is of central importance for all these comparisons. Estimates of isotopic fractionation between source and measured target are important if specific hypotheses regarding the source elements are addressed. Estimates of isotopic fractionation, or at least of differences in fractionation between tissues, are necessary if different tissues are compared. We urge for more laboratory experiments aimed at improving our understanding of differential assimilation of dietary components, isotopic fractionation and metabolic routing. We further encourage more studies on reptiles and amphibians, and generally more studies utilizing multiple tissues with different turnover rates.},

These 2 quantities are estimated in laboratory experiments on diet shifts in which results are interpreted using simple mathematical models, which we describe here. The simplest of these models assumes that each tissue can be represented as a well-mixed, single compartment that obeys 1st-order kinetics. Fitting this model to experimental data allows estimating discrimination factors and the instantaneous rate of isotopic incorporation, λ (the reciprocal of λ, 1/λ, equals the average residence time, τ, of an atom in the tissue). In 1-compartment models the magnitude of λ equals the sum of catabolic turnover and mass-specific growth rate. Examination of available data suggests that the magnitude of λ scales with body mass to an exponent equal to approximately −0.25, differs between endo...},

   pages = {341-351},
   abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant nitrogen isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the nitrogen in an animal reflects the nitrogen isotopic composition of its diet. The δ 15N values of the whole bodies of animals are usually more positive than those of their diets. Different individuals of a species raised on the same diet can have significantly different δ 15N values. The variability of the relationship between the δ 15N values of animals and their diets is greater for different species raised on the same diet than for the same species raised on different diets. Different tissues of mice are also enriched in 15N relative to the diet, with the difference between the δ 15N values of a tissue and the diet depending on both the kind of tissue and the diet involved. The δ 15N values ofcollagen and chitin. biochemical components that are often preserved in fossil animal remains, are also related to the δ 15N value of the diet. The dependence of the δ 15N values of whole animals and their tissues and biochemical components on the δ 15N value of diet indicates that the isotopic composition of animal nitrogen can be used to obtain information about an animal's diet if its potential food sources had different δ 15N values. The nitrogen isotopic method of dietary analysis probably can be used to estimate the relative use of legumes vs non-legumes or of aquatic vs terrestrial organisms as food sources for extant and fossil animals. However, the method probably will not be applicable in those modern ecosystems in which the use of chemical fertilizers has influenced the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in food sources. The isotopic method of dietary analysis was used to reconstruct changes in the diet of the human population that occupied the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico over a 7000 yr span. Variations in the δ 15C and δ 15N values of bone collagen suggest that C 4 and/or CAM plants (presumably mostly corn) and legumes (presumably mostly beans) were introduced into the diet much earlier than suggested by conventional archaeological analysis.},

   abstract = {Fluctuations in an animal’s trophic position (TP) can indicate changes within an ecosystem. Traditionally, bulk tissue or whole animal nitrogen (N) isotope analysis has been used to determine an animal’s TP, but there are limitations to the application of this approach. Amino acid compound-specific isotope analysis (AA-CSIA) can be used to determine TP based on the difference between the δ N values of certain amino acids, commonly glutamic acid and phenylalanine. The rate at which N is incorporated into amino acids is largely unknown, and this may affect the accuracy of relative TP estimates especially during periods of ecosystem change or ontogenetic changes in diet. To study amino acid turnover rates, the diet of the Pacific white shrimp was changed in the laboratory from an unlabeled diet (7.2‰) to a N-enriched diet (24‰), and animals were sampled over the course of 7 wk. AA-CSIA revealed that turnover times of amino acids vary considerably, with some amino acids having much more rapid turnover than others. The TP of (using δ N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine) over the course of the experiment remained constant, and shrimp TP averaged 2.14 ± 0.15 (mean ± SD, n = 7) relative to its diet, which was as expected. Our results indicate that the δ N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine can be used to accurately determine TP even while shrimp are undergoing a change to a diet with a different δ N value.},

   volume = {27},
   number = {11},
   pages = {2328-2342},
   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial variability of these changes. Understanding how regional‐scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ13C and δ15N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web‐assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production‐nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long‐term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ13C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs. Environmental factors determine resource availability and primary production in marine ecosystems. Stable isotope data from consumer tissues can provide useful indices of nitrogen and carbon resources that are sequestered by primary producers, passed through the food web, and ultimately assimilated into top predators. Based on the stable isotope composition of harbor seal bone specimens from the past century, we determined environmental factors that impact resources assimilated into food webs vary regionally within the northeast Pacific.},

   volume = {245},

   abstract = {Marine coastal areas have high social-economic relevance and ensuring the good quality of these areas has gained importance in the past decades due to the increase of anthropogenic pressures. Understanding the dynamics of these areas is crucial to support management decisions. In this context, phytoplankton communities are generally used as key indicators of environmental quality as they respond in short time-scales and are at the base of food webs. This work intends to improve our understanding on how phytoplankton communities respond to environmental conditions, particularly in upwelling areas. Seawater samples were collected from Algarrobo Bay, Central Chile, for both phytoplankton pigments and microscopy analysis. Data were analyzed in combination with physico-chemical parameters and two distinct hydrographic regions were identified for the study area: i) a region occupying most of the northern bay section, characterized by lower temperatures and dissolved oxygen (DO), higher concentration of nutrients and higher N:P, where a mixed community with diatoms, chrysophytes, cryptophytes, haptophytes and other small flagellates were observed; and ii) a central-southern section, with higher temperatures and DO, lower nutrients and lower N:P, where diatoms, in particular the centric diatom Chaetoceros Ehrenberg, 1844 sp. (~92.5% on average), dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. Other common but much less abundant diatom genus included Skeletonema Greville, 1865, Eucampia Ehrenberg, 1839, Dactyliosolen Castracane, 1886, Nitzschia Hassall, 1845, Cylindrotheca Rabenhorst, 1859 and Asterionellopsis Round, 1990. Apart from diatoms, the most abundant taxa belonged to flagellates, mainly chrysophytes (228.4 × 103 cells L−1 on average) and cryptophytes (213 × 103 cells L−1 on average). Overall, results suggest that the southern part of the Algarrobo Bay, with higher residence times and nutrient discharges, may act as an upwelling shadow area, where phytoplankton species can accumulate. •Phytoplankton and environmental conditions were evaluated in a coastal bay under upwelling influence.•High phytoplankton biomass and diatom dominance were seen in the southern part of the bay.•Diatoms favored by cold and saline waters and flagellates were linked to the opposite conditions.•Two main regions characterized by distinct phytoplankton communities were found.•A potential zone of both upwelling shadow and anthropogenic impact is identified.},

   pages = {265-277},
   abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (AA) is a rapidly growing tool in ecological studies to assess diet and trophic position (TP) in both modern and ancient foodwebs. We conducted the first controlled feeding study examining δ N values in AAs in a marine mammal (harbor seal ). The pattern of δ N variation among AAs in seals was similar to that observed in other heterotrophs, although exceptions were found with proline and threonine. However, many δ N changes with trophic transfer were very different than those reported for zooplankton and other lower TP marine consumers. In particular the measured trophic enrichment factor (TEF) now broadly used for TP estimation (TEF ) was much lower in harbor seals (~4.3‰) than the current commonly applied value (~7.5‰). Recently published data on wild marine birds (penguins) and elasmobranchs (stingrays) suggests that similar, low TEF values may also be characteristic of these taxa. Together, these data imply that marine mammals and other higher animals have different, but also diagnostic, changes in δ N-AA with trophic transfer vs. organisms examined in previous feeding studies (e.g. zooplankton, bony fish and mollusks), possibly due to dietary protein content, trophic position, and/or form of nitrogen excretion (urea vs. ammonia). Therefore, we propose that for marine mammals, a multi-TEF calculation is required to account for variations of TEF between animals within a food web, and we demonstrate that this approach can predict accurate TP estimates for harbor seals. These results also have significant implication for the application of compound-specific isotope analysis of AAs on terrestrial ecology and trophic structure.},

The variability characterized by seasonal mean, minimum, maximum, and amplitude (defined as maximum — minimum) from 36 lakes with seasonal data did not change systematically with latitude, but was significantly lower in small lakes than in large lakes. The seasonal mean increased from oligotrophic lakes to eutrophic lakes despite large variations that are attributed to the occurrences of nitrogen fixation across the trophic gradient and the differences in δ¹⁵N of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in individual lakes. Seasonal mean was significantly correlated with DIN concentration and in two subsets of lakes. Seasonal minimum in individual lakes is influenced by nitrogen fixation and while seasonal maximum is influenced by lake trophic state and . As a result of the dominance of non-living POM in the unproductive surface waters, seasonal amplitude was small (mean = 4.2% o) in oligotrophic lakes of all latitudes. On the other hand, seasonal amplitude in eutrophic lakes was large (mean = lO. 3% c), and increased from low to high latitudes, suggesting that the seasonal variability of δ¹⁵N in the phytoplankton-dominated POM pool was elevated by the greater spans of solar radiation and thermal regimes at high latitudes. The from 42 lakes with no seasonal data revealed no consistent patterns along latitude, lake area, and trophic gradients, and a greater than 2% e depletion compared to the lakes with seasonal data. Along with the large seasonal variability of within lakes, these results provide insightful information on sampling design for the studies of food web baseline in lakes.},

   abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were used to track energy flow and nutrient cycling pathways in the plankton food web of a subarctic Alaskan lake. Results indicated that planktonic primary production was the major energy source fueling the zooplankton community. In spring, δ 15 N of Daphnia was strongly influenced by atmospheric nitrogen derived from a N 2 -fixing blue-green algal bloom. In winter, δ 13 C evidence suggested that phytoplankton comprised a small fraction (~15%) of particulate organic matter (POM) in the water column, largely due to low primary productivity. The disparity between δ 13 C of POM and Daphnia in winter may result from preferential assimilation of isotopically light algal carbon from POM. Nitrogen isotope values showed that Heterocope, a presumed carnivore, probably relied heavily on POM as a nutrient source. In common with some arctic lakes, the δ 15 N data showed less than three trophic levels in this plankton food web. The energy transfer pathways and trophic levels revealed a simple plankton trophic structure in this subarctic lacustrine system.},

   abstract = {We used amino acid (AA) compound-specific isotope analysis ( N and C values) of midwater zooplankton and suspended particles to examine their dynamics in the mesopelagic zone. Suspended particle N values increased by up to 14‰ with depth, whereas particle trophic status (measured as trophic position, TP) remained constant at 1.6 ± 0.07. Applying a Rayleigh distillation model to these results gave an observed kinetic isotope fractionation of 5.7 ± 0.4‰, similar to that previously measured for protein hydrolysis. AA-based degradation index values also decreased with depth on the particles, whereas a measure of heterotrophic resynthesis (ΣV) remained constant at 1.2 ± 0.3. The main mechanism driving N enrichment of suspended particles appears to be isotope fractionation associated with heterotrophic degradation, rather than a change in trophic status or N source with depth. In zooplankton the “source” AA phenylalanine (Phe) became N enriched by up to 3.5‰ with depth, whereas zooplankton TP increased by up to 0.65 between the surface ocean and midwaters. Both changes in the N values of food resources at the base of the zooplankton food web and changes in zooplankton TP drive observed zooplankton N enrichment with depth. Midwater zooplankton N values were lower by 5–8‰ compared with suspended particles, indicating this organic matter pool is not a significant zooplankton food resource at depth. Instead, 62–88% of the N sustaining midwater zooplankton is surface derived, obtained through consumption of sinking particles, carnivory of vertical migrants, or direct feeding in surface waters at night.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT Natural abundances of stable isotopes in lotic food webs yield valuable information about sources of organic matter for consumers and trophic structure. However, interpretation of isotopic information can be challenging in the face of variability in organisms at the base of food webs. Unionid and dreissenid mussels, commonly used as baseline organisms in lakes, are uncommon in many river settings and can have variable diets, thus making them unsuitable as a universal baseline for many river food web studies and often forcing reliance on more common benthic insects for this purpose. Turnover rates of body carbon and nitrogen in insects are relatively rapid (1 to 50 days half‐life). These rapid turnover rates in primary consumers can result in considerable temporal variability in δ13C that rivals that of algae (>10‰ range within a site). This suggests that using primary consumers as a surrogate baseline for algae may not circumvent the problem of temporal variability and the resultant mismatch of sources with longer‐lived, slow‐growing secondary and tertiary consumers. There are several strategies for reducing the influence of these confounding factors when bivalves with a known diet are not present. These include sampling over large spatial scales and correlating δ13C of consumers with the source of interest (e.g. benthic algae), sampling baseline organisms multiple times in the weeks preceding sampling of larger consumers (particularly in response to large changes in discharge) and using algal‐detrital separation methods and multiple tracers as much as possible. Incorporating some of these recommendations and further exploring variability at the base of the food web will potentially provide greater insights into consumer–resource coupling in running waters and more robust conclusions about food web structure and energy flow in these dynamic systems.

   abstract = {Given annual occurrences of hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, and evidence of coastal acidification, the potential impacts of climate change on water quality are of increasing concern in the U.S. Pacific Northwest estuaries such as the Salish Sea. While large‐scale global climate projections are well documented, our understanding of the nearshore estuarine‐scale response is not as well developed. In this study, the future response within the Salish Sea fjord‐like environment was examined using the Salish Sea Model driven by downscaled outputs from the National Center for Atmospheric Research climate model Community Earth System Model. We simulated a single projection of 95‐year change under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results indicate that higher temperatures, lower pH, and decreased dissolved oxygen levels in the upwelled shelf waters in the future would propagate into the Salish Sea. Results point to potential changes in average Salish Sea temperature (≈+1.51 °C), dissolved oxygen (≈−0.77 mg/L), and pH (acidification −0.18 units) in the Y2095 relative to historical Y2000. The algal biomass in the Salish Sea could increase by ≈23% with a potential species shift from diatoms toward dinoflagellates. The region of annually recurring hypoxia could increase from <1% today to ≈16% in the future. The results suggest that the future response in the Salish Sea is less severe relative to the change predicted near the continental shelf boundary. This resilience of the Salish Sea may be attributed to the existence of strong vertical circulation cells that provide mitigation and serve as a physical buffer, thus keeping waters cooler, more oxygenated, and less acidic. Key Points Y2095 climate change impact on Salish Sea under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario was examined using a downscaled global climate projection Hypoxia is projected to expand from <1% to approximately equal to 16% of the total area, along with strong T impacts and S intrusion in the intertidal regions Salish Sea future change: T + 1.51 degrees celsius, DO −0.77 mg/L, pH −0.18, and 23% increase in algal biomass; small impacts on circulation},

   abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is one of the most widely used techniques to estimate trophic position and provides fundamental insight into the structure and management of ecological communities. To account for the effects of geographic variation in isotope levels, trophic position is typically estimated relative to an isotope “baseline” (i.e., material representing geographic variation) using a methodology such as a formula or statistical analysis. There is, however, remarkable variation in the baselines and methodologies used to estimate trophic position from stable isotopes. The consequences of this lack of standardization are unknown but could result in biased or erroneous conclusions. We conducted a literature review to quantify the variation in baselines and methodologies used to estimate trophic position from stable isotopes. Next, we assessed the consequences of this variation on individual species estimates and food web structure by extracting published trophic positions and applying various baselines and methodologies to existing data sets. We identified 10 baselines and eight methodologies, the use of which varied by ecosystem studied. Moreover, we found that different baselines and methodologies yield significantly different trophic position estimates for individual species, as well as different conclusions about food web structure. Authors should avoid biological interpretations of absolute, stand‐alone trophic positions (as these are prone to a number of biases). We recommend pairing stable isotope analysis with other techniques for more robust conclusions. Increased sample size may mitigate some of the variation caused by different baselines and methodologies; however, an alarmingly large proportion of studies collected only one sample in at least one trophic group (41% of all reviewed studies). Authors should collect a minimum of five samples per trophic group (but ten for best practices) from as many trophic groups as possible to increase statistical power and redundancy in comparisons. When sample size is unavoidably constrained, we recommend using compound‐specific isotope analysis with a taxon‐specific trophic discrimination factor, because it may be more accurate and require fewer samples to maintain appropriate statistical power. Implementing our recommendations will increase the robustness and accuracy of conclusions based on stable isotopes, resulting in better management decisions and a more accurate understanding of ecological communities.},

   abstract = {To identify the seasonal pattern of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton in four different lakes, biweekly experiments were conducted from the end of March to September 2011. Lake water samples were enriched with N, P or both nutrients and incubated under two different light intensities. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chla) was measured and a model selection procedure was used to assign bioassay outcomes to different limitation categories. N and P were both limiting at some point. For the shallow lakes there was a trend from P limitation in spring to N or light limitation later in the year, while the deep lake remained predominantly P limited. To determine the ability of in-lake N:P ratios to predict the relative strength of N vs. P limitation, three separate regression models were fit with the log-transformed ratio of Chla of the P and N treatments (Response ratio = RR) as the response variable and those of ambient total phosphorus:total nitrogen (TN:TP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen:soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN:SRP), TN:SRP and DIN:TP mass ratios as predictors. All four N:P ratios had significant positive relationships with RR, such that high N:P ratios were associated with P limitation and low N:P ratios with N limitation. The TN:TP and DIN:TP ratios performed better than the DIN:SRP and TN:SRP in terms of misclassification rate and the DIN:TP ratio had the highest R₂ value. Nitrogen limitation was predictable, frequent and persistent, suggesting that nitrogen reduction could play a role in water quality management. However, there is still uncertainty about the efficacy of N restriction to control populations of N₂ fixing cyanobacteria.},

   abstract = {Assessment of isotopic compositions at the base of food webs is a prerequisite for using stable isotope analysis to assess foraging locations and trophic positions of marine organisms. Our study represents a unique application of stable-isotope analyses across multiple trophic levels (primary producer, primary consumer and tertiary consumer) and over a large spatial scale in two pelagic marine ecosystems. We found that δ15N values of particulate organic matter (POM), barnacles and phenylalanine from the muscle tissue of yellowfin tuna all showed similar spatial patterns. This consistency suggests that isotopic analysis of any of these can provide a reasonable proxy for isotopic variability at the base of the food web. Secondly, variations in the δ15N values of yellowfin tuna bulk-muscle tissues paralleled the spatial trends observed in all of these isotopic baseline proxies. Variation in isotopic composition at the base of the food web, rather than differences in tuna diet, explained the 11‰ variability observed in the bulk-tissue δ15N values of yellowfin tuna. Evaluating the trophic position of yellowfin tuna using amino-acid isotopic compositions across the western Indian and equatorial Pacific Oceans strongly suggests these tuna occupy similar trophic positions, albeit absolute trophic positions estimated by this method were lower than expected. This study reinforces the importance of considering isotopic baseline variability for diet studies, and provides new insights into methods that can be applied to generate nitrogen isoscapes for worldwide comparisons of top predators in marine ecosystems.},

Here, we compared FishBase estimates for an assemblage of 30 fish species sampled in a Mediterranean lagoon (Acquatina lagoon, SE Italy) with their trophic positions calculated using nitrogen stable isotopes. To assess the influence of the trophic level used to compute the baseline indicator on the robustness of isotopic estimations, we compared the trophic position of fish calculated using the average δ15N signature of either basal resource or primary consumer taxa measured at three stations located in the lagoon in July and November 2007. In general, basal resources showed negligible among-station and inter-season variations in their δ15N values; however, they were characterized by a high inter-specific heterogeneity, with signatures varying by approximately 10 per mil units. In contrast, whereas primary consumer signatures showed significant spatial and temporal variations, they were characterized by a lower inter-specific variability. Fish trophic positions estimated using primary consumers as the isotopic baseline were highly correlated with values provided by FishBase, independently from whether the latter were calculated on either diet data or individual prey items. Conversely, estimations using a basal resources as the baseline indicator were significantly less correlated with FishBase estimates. The present study emphasized the crucial importance played by inter-specific variability in baseline taxa signatures for a robust assessment of fish trophic position, and confirmed primary consumers as the best candidate for baseline estimation. In addition, our results indicate that, notwithstanding the limitations characterizing the data provided in FishBase, they represent an adequate source of information on the trophic ecology of fish.},

Annual averages of the δ15N of plankton (C, LT, E > D, H > POM) matched expected differences in trophic position, but seasonal patterns differed among species. During midsummer, the δ15N of D, H, and LT increased above the δ15N of E and C, despite little temporal or spatial variation in the δ15N of POM (<41 µm). Larger size fractions of POM (41-200 µm) helped explain some of the temporal variability of zooplankton δ15N. Body size of zooplankton was correlated with δ15N for D, C, and E, which could indicate size-based, trophic-level variation; selective feeding; or physiological differences in 15N enrichment. We propose that detailed time series of δ15N for multiple zooplankton species can help determine the seasonal variability of trophic structure in zooplankton assemblages.Nous avons mesuré les δ15N de la matière organique particulaire (POM), de Daphnia pulex (D), d'Holopedium gibberum (H), de Leptodiaptomus tyrelli (LT), d'Epischura nevadensis (E) et de Chaoborus trivittatus (C) durant un cycle annuel au lac Council, un lac oligotrophe non perturbé et sans poissons. Les valeurs moyennes annuelles de δ15N du plancton (C, LT, E > D, H > POM) correspondent aux différences attendues, compte tenu des positions trophiques, mais les patrons saisonniers varient d'une espèce à l'autre. Durant la mi-été, les δ15N de D, H et LT dépassent les δ15N de E et C, malgré le peu de variation temporelle ou spatiale du δ15N de POM (<41 µm). Les fractions de plus grande taille de POM (41-200 µm) aident à expliquer une partie de la variabilité temporelle du δ15N du plancton. Il y a une corrélation entre la taille corporelle du zooplancton et le δ15N chez D, C et E, ce qui pourrait indiquer une variation du niveau trophique, une alimentation sélective ou des différences physiologiques dans l'enrichissement en δ15N en fonction de la taille. Nous croyons que des séries chronologiques détaillées de δ15N pour plusieurs espèces du zooplancton pourraient aider à déterminer la variabilité saisonnière de la structure trophique des peuplements de zooplancton.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

   abstract = {Bulk nitrogen (N) isotope signatures have long been used to investigate organic N source and food web structure in aquatic ecosystems. This paper explores the use of compound-specific δ 15N patterns of amino acids (δ 15N-AA) as a new tool to examine source and processing history in non-living marine organic matter. We measured δ 15N-AA distributions in plankton tows, sinking particulate organic matter (POM), and ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) in the central Pacific Ocean. δ 15N-AA patterns in eukaryotic algae and mixed plankton tows closely resemble those previously reported in culture. δ 15N differences between individual amino acids (AA) strongly suggest that the sharply divergent δ 15N enrichment for different AA with trophic transfer, as first reported by [McClelland, J.W. and Montoya, J.P. (2002) Trophic relationships and the nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids. Ecology 83, 2173–2180], is a general phenomenon. In addition, differences in δ 15N of individual AA indicative of trophic transfers are clearly preserved in sinking POM, along with additional changes that may indicate subsequent microbial reworking after incorporation into particles. We propose two internally normalized δ 15N proxies that track heterotrophic processes in detrital organic matter. Both are based on isotopic signatures in multiple AA, chosen to minimize potential problems associated with any single compound in degraded materials. A trophic level indicator (ΔTr) is derived from the δ 15N difference between selected groups of AA based on their relative enrichment with trophic transfer. We propose that a corresponding measure of the variance within a sub-group of AA (designated Σ V) may indicate total AA resynthesis, and be strongly tied to heterotrophic microbial reworking in detrital materials. Together, we hypothesize that ΔTr and Σ V define a two dimensional trophic “space”, which may simultaneously express relative extent of eukaryotic and bacterial heterotrophic processing. In the equatorial Pacific, ΔTr indicates an average of 1.5–2 trophic transfers between phytoplankton and sinking POM at all depths and locations. The Σ V parameter suggests that substantial variation may exist in bacterial heterotrophic processing between differing regions and time periods. In dissolved material δ 15N-AA patterns appear unrelated to those in POM. In contrast to POM, δ 15N-AA signatures in UDOM show no clear changes with depth, and suggest that dissolved AA preserved throughout the oceanic water column have undergone few, if any, trophic transfers. Together these data suggest a sharp divide between processing histories, and possibly sources, of particulate vs. dissolved AA.},

   abstract = {In order to inform policies aimed at reducing nutrient emissions to surface waters, it is essential to understand how aquatic ecosystems respond to eutrophication management. Using data from 89 studies worldwide, we examined responses to the reduction or cessation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs relative to baseline conditions. Baseline conditions were pre-disturbance conditions, undisturbed reference sites, restoration targets, or experimental controls. We estimated recovery completeness (% baseline conditions reached) and recovery rate (annual % change relative to baseline conditions) for plant and animal abundance and diversity and for ecosystem functions. Categories were considered fully recovered if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of recovery completeness overlapped 100% and partially recovered if the CI did not overlap either 100% or zero. Cessation of nutrient inputs did not result in more complete or faster recovery than partial nutrient reductions, due likely to insufficient passage of time, nutrients from other sources, or shifting baselines. Together, lakes and coastal marine areas achieved 34% (±16% CI) and 24% (±15% CI) of baseline conditions decades after the cessation or partial reduction of nutrients, respectively. One third of individual response variables showed no change or worsened conditions, suggesting that achieving baseline conditions may not be possible in all cases. Implied recovery times after cessation of nutrient inputs varied widely, from < 1 yr to nearly a century, depending on response. Our results suggest that long-term monitoring is needed to better understand recovery timescales and trajectories and that policy measures must consider the potential for slow and partial recovery.},

   abstract = {Compound‐specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of amino acids (AA) has rapidly become a powerful tool in studies of food web architecture, resource use, and biogeochemical cycling. However, applications to avian ecology have been limited because no controlled studies have examined the patterns in AA isotope fractionation in birds. We conducted a controlled CSIA feeding experiment on an avian species, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), to examine patterns in individual AA carbon and nitrogen stable isotope fractionation between diet (D) and consumer (C) (Δ13CC‐D and Δ15NC‐D, respectively). We found that essential AA δ13C values and source AA δ15N values in feathers showed minimal trophic fractionation between diet and consumer, providing independent but complimentary archival proxies for primary producers and nitrogen sources respectively, at the base of food webs supporting penguins. Variations in nonessential AA Δ13CC‐D values reflected differences in macromolecule sources used for biosynthesis (e.g., protein vs. lipids) and provided a metric to assess resource utilization. The avian‐specific nitrogen trophic discrimination factor (TDFGlu‐Phe = 3.5 ± 0.4‰) that we calculated from the difference in trophic fractionation (Δ15NC‐D) of glutamic acid and phenylalanine was significantly lower than the conventional literature value of 7.6‰. Trophic positions of five species of wild penguins calculated using a multi‐TDFGlu‐Phe equation with the avian‐specific TDFGlu‐Phe value from our experiment provided estimates that were more ecologically realistic than estimates using a single TDFGlu‐Phe of 7.6‰ from the previous literature. Our results provide a quantitative, mechanistic framework for the use of CSIA in nonlethal, archival feathers to study the movement and foraging ecology of avian consumers. Compound‐specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids has rapidly become a powerful tool in studies of food web architecture, resource use, and biogeochemical cycling. We conducted a controlled feeding experiment on gentoo penguins to examine patterns in individual amino acid carbon and nitrogen isotope fractionation in non‐lethal, archival feathers. Using the newly derived avian‐specific amino acid fractionation factors, we examined wild penguin foraging ecology and trophic dynamics in the Southern Ocean, including identifying the sources of primary production supporting wild penguins and calculating wild penguin trophic position.},

   journal = {Trends in ecology & evolution (Amsterdam)},
   volume = {30},
   number = {11},
   pages = {662-672},
   abstract = {Temporal variation characterizes many of Earth's ecosystems. Despite this, little is known about how food webs respond to regular variation in time, such as occurs broadly with season. We argue that season, and likely any periodicity, structures food webs along a temporal axis in an analogous way to that previously recognized in space; predators shift their diet as different resource compartments and trophic levels become available through time. These characteristics are likely (i) central to ecosystem function and stability based on theory, and (ii) widespread across ecosystem types based on empirical observations. The temporal food web perspective outlined here could provide new insight into the ecosystem-level consequences of altered abiotic and biotic processes that might accompany globally changing environments. Temporal environmental variation is ubiquitous in nature and appears to consistently structure food webs in many ecosystems. Such abiotic variation drives different resources to become available during different times. Consumers buffer this variation via dormancy, migration, or by temporally shifting their diet towards abundant resources. These temporal food web characteristics likely sustain ecosystem functions in the face of naturally-variable conditions. Global environmental changes are threatening these existing abiotic signals and the biotic processes that are structured around them. Failure to study food webs on a temporal axis represents a missed opportunity to better understand ecosystem structure and function in a changing world and could be detrimental for efforts aimed at anticipating and mediating the consequences of novel periodicities on key ecosystem functions.},

   abstract = {Changes in food web dynamics and ocean productivity over the past 4500 years are investigated using stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in collagen from animal bones preserved in coastal archeological middens on Sanak Island, along the eastern edge of the Aleutian archipelgo. Samples included Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, Northern fur seals, sea otters, Pacific cod and sockeye salmon. Sea otters had the highest δ13C (−11.9 ± 0.7‰) and lowest δ15N values (14.5 ± 1.4‰), Northern fur seals had the lowest δ13C values (−13.6 ± 1.4‰), and Steller sea lions had the highest δ15N values (18.4 ± 1.4‰) of the marine mammals. Cod isotope values were consistent with those of demersal organisms from near shore habitats (−12.5 ± 0.9‰ δ13C, 16.1 ± 1.4‰ δ15N), while salmon values were consistent with those of organisms existing in an open ocean habitat and at a lower trophic level (−15.2 ± 1.4‰ δ13C, 11.5 ± 1.7‰ δ15N). When comparing six different prehistoric time periods, two time periods had significantly different δ 13C for salmon. Otters had significantly different δ15N values in two out of the six prehistoric time periods but no differences in δ13C. The mean δ13C, corrected for the oceanic Suess Effect, of modern specimens of all species (except Northern fur seals) were significantly lower than prehistoric animals. Several hypotheses are explored to explain these differences including a reduction in productivity during the twentieth century in this region of the Gulf of Alaska. If true, this suggests that North Pacific climate regimes experienced during the twentieth century may not be good analogs of North Pacific marine ecosystems during the late Holocene.},

   pages = {631-642},
   abstract = {Estimating trophic structures is a common approach used to retrieve information regarding energy pathways, predation, and competition in complex ecosystems. The application of amino acid (AA) compoundspecific nitrogen (N) isotope analysis (CSIA) is a relatively new method used to estimate trophic position (TP) and feeding relationships in diverse organisms. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of δ¹⁵N AA values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the ¹⁵N enrichment among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and whether inclusion of δ¹⁵N values from multiple AAs improves TP estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe) we found an average value of 6.6 % c across all taxa, which is significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 ‰. We found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the metadata of δ¹⁵N AA values we show that increasing the number of AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual δ¹⁵N AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.},

   abstract = {We review the biochemical and physiological bases of the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions as an approach for environmental and ecological studies. Biochemical processes commonly observed in the biosphere, including the decarboxylation and deamination of amino acids, are the key factors in this isotopic approach. The principles drawn from the isotopic distributions disentangle the complex dynamics of the biosphere and allow the interactions between the geosphere and biosphere to be analyzed in detail. We also summarize two recently examined topics with new datasets: the isotopic compositions of individual biosynthetic products (chlorophylls and amino acids) and those of animal organs for further pursuing the basis of the methodology. As a tool for investigating complex systems, compound-specific isotopic analysis compensates the intrinsic disadvantages of bulk isotopic signatures. Chlorophylls provide information about the particular processes of various photoautotrophs, whereas amino acids provide a precise measure of the trophic positions of heterotrophs. The isotopic distributions of carbon and nitrogen in a single organism as well as in the whole biosphere are strongly regulated, so that their major components such as amino acids are coordinated appropriately rather than controlled separately.},

This chapter analyzes the nitrogen isotopic composition of individual amino acids in white muscle tissue (WMT) of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) from the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) to determine if the observed variations in the δ15N values of WMT are primarily controlled by the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the food web or the trophic level of the tuna. The difference between the δ15N values of source and trophic amino acids is used to estimate the trophic level of yellowfin, and this is compared to the estimates based on two independent methods, stomach content analysis and the isotopic difference between the δ15N values of mesozooplankton and yellowfin tuna in the ETP. It is found that nitrogen isotopic analyses of individual amino acids in tuna can be used to distinguish between nutrient and trophic dynamics in pelagic ecosystems, and the implications of these results are discussed for investigating the long-term impact of commercial fishing on the food web structure of marine ecosystems.},

   journal = {Marine ecology. Progress series (Halstenbek)},
   volume = {666},
   pages = {19-30},
   abstract = {Nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ15N) are routinely used to estimate consumer trophic positions (TPs). This method is very sensitive to the chosen isotopic baseline, which should incorporate all temporal isotopic variability occurring in the base of the food web sustaining the consumers. However, there is still no consensus on the different methods to represent time intervals for isotopic assimilation. It is uncertain if researchers should compute a single baseline obtained by averaging δ15N source values across all time periods, multiple baselines based on δ15N source values collected concomitantly with consumers, or consider a time lag between sources and consumers. Aiming to provide empirical evidence to help select the best option, we designed 4 methods using different temporal lags between consumers and producers based on a 9 yr time series of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in an estuary. The 4 tested baseline methods considered the δ15N average of producers sampled in all years (Global); the same season as consumers (Concomitantly); the season before the collection of consumers (Delayed); and the previous season as well as the same season of consumer sampling (Interpolation). Comparison of results with an expected model (based on stomach content data) showed that the Delayed method is the most appropriate. We conclude that time lags in the incorporation of stable isotope values between sources and consumers must be considered in baseline δ15N calculations to improve TP estimates and provide more reliable modeling results. Additionally, we provide other recommendations to improve sampling designs when using stable isotopes in TP estimations.},

   abstract = {The stable isotopes of nitrogen (Δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 SD = l‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 SD = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

   volume = {197},
   pages = {81-101},
   abstract = {The use of riverine allochthonous organic matter by plankton in the northern Baltic Sea was studied using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Dissolved and particulate material was sampled in the main Swedish rivers entering the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea. At 4 sea stations, dissolved matter, plankton and nekton were sampled in 11 size-classes: below 0.7 μm filtrate, 0.7–5, 5–20, 20–50, 50–100, 100–200, 200–500, 500–2500 μm, mysids (∼10 and ∼20 mm) and herring. A riverine influence could be detected in δ13C, but not in δ15N. Except for the 5–20 μm fraction, the carbon became enriched in 13C with increasing salinity in all plankton size-fractions. This mainly reflected differences in the δ13C of phytoplankton, due to the different δ13C of marine and riverine dissolved inorganic carbon. Plankton use of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was tested with a 2-component model. The δ13C of riverine DOC and the basin phytoplankton were taken to represent the allochthonous and autochthonous signals, respectively. Use of riverine DOC was indicated for larger zooplankton (200–2500 μm) in the Bothnian Bay, confirming earlier suggestions of extensive use of riverine DOC in the zooplankton food webs in this basin. A new method to adjust δ13C in zooplankton for variations in lipid content by analysis of covariance was successfully demonstrated. The isotope data reflect the presence of 2 trophic structures, coinciding with the microheterotrophic food web (0.7–5 μm) and the classic grazing food web (>50 μm). From phytoplankton to large zooplankton, δ15N increased linearly with the logarithm of organism size in all basins. This increase was steeper in the Bothnian Sea and the Baltic Proper, where zooplankton diversity is higher, than in the Bothnian Bay, possibly reflecting more complex food-web interactions.},

   abstract = {Stomach contents and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope analysis were used to evaluate trophic relationships of jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas. Buccal masses, beaks and stomach contents of large and medium maturing-sized jumbo squid and muscle from its main prey, the myctophid Benthosema panamense, were collected in the Gulf of California, Mexico during 1996, 1997 and 1999. Both the quantified C and N-isotope ratios in muscle, and stomach content analysis revealed that larger-sized maturing squid showed a higher trophic position than medium-sized individuals. However, a discrepancy between stomach contents versus stable isotope analyses was found in evaluating trophic relationships. Simple dilution models as a function of growth were used to estimate the C and N renewal dietary shift for jumbo squid. Estimates of the initial C and N pools in D. gigas with an initial age of 70 days and 210 days indicated isotopic shifts of 32% after a threefold biomass increase and 25% after a fourfold biomass increase, respectively. Additionally, beak samples of jumbo squid were evaluated as an alternative tissue to estimate squid trophic position using stable isotopes. The results showed a significant correlation between stable isotope ratios from muscle and beak samples. Muscle isotope values were higher than beak by 1% and 4% for δ13C and δ15N respectively. A test with jumbo squid beaks collected from a stomach of a stranded sperm whale confirmed the viability of this method.},

   journal = {Marine ecology. Progress series (Halstenbek)},

   pages = {135-148},
   abstract = {The deep-sea gorgonian coral Primnoa spp. live in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at depths of 65 to 3200 m. They have an arborescent growth form with a skeletal axis composed of annual rings made from calcite and gorgonin. Lifespans may exceed several hundreds of years. It has been suggested that isotope profiles from the gorgonin fraction of the skeleton could be used to reconstruct long-term, annual-scale variations in surface productivity. We tested assumptions about the trophic level, intra- and inter-colony isotopic reproducibility, and preservation of isotopic signatures in a suite of modern and fossil specimens. Measurements of gorgonin delta N-15 indicate that Primnoa spp. feed mainly on zooplankton and/or sinking particulate organic matter (POMsink), and not on suspended POM (POMsusp) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Gorgonin delta C-13 and delta N-15 in specimens from NE Pacific shelf waters, NW Atlantic slope waters, the Sea of Japan, and a South Pacific (Southern Ocean sector) seamount were strongly correlated with surface apparent oxygen utilization (AOU; the best available measure of surface productivity), demonstrating coupling between skeletal isotopic ratios and biophysical processes in surface water. Time-series isotopic profiles from different sections along the same colony, and different colonies inhabiting the same area were identical for delta C-13, while delta N-15 profiles were less reproducible. Similarity in C:N, delta C-13 and delta(15) N between modern and fossil specimens suggest that isotopic signatures are preserved over millennial timescales. These results support the use of Primnoa spp. as historical recorders of surface water processes such as biological productivity and the isotopic composition of source nutrients.},

Isotopic results delimit species along continua of trophic level and food lability. With an isotopic signature similar to macrozooplankton, Paragorgia arborea occupies the lowest trophic level and most likely feeds on fresh phytodetritus. Primnoa resedaeformis occupies a slightly higher trophic level, likely supplementing its diet with microzooplankton. Bathypathes arctica, Pennatulacea and other alcyonaceans ( Acanella arbuscula, Acanthogorgia armata, Anthomastus grandiflorus, Duva florida, Keratoisis ornata, Paramuricea sp.) had higher δ 13C and δ 15N values, suggesting these species feed at higher trophic levels and on a greater proportion of more degraded POM. Flabellum alabastrum had an isotopic signature similar to that of snow crab, indicating a primarily carnivorous diet. Isotopic composition did not vary significantly over a depth gradient of 50–1400 m. Coral δ 13C increased slightly (<1‰) from the Hudson Strait to the southern Grand Banks, but δ 15N did not. By modulating the availability and quality of suspended foods, substrate likely exerts a primary influence on the feeding habits of cold-water corals.},

   abstract = {Despite the importance of the nitrogen (N) cycle on marine productivity, little is known about variability in N sources and cycling in the ocean in relation to natural and anthropogenic climate change. Beyond the last few decades of scientific observation, knowledge depends largely on proxy records derived from nitrogen stable isotopes (δ 15 N) preserved in sediments and other bioarchives. Traditional bulk δ 15 N measurements, however, represent the combined influence of N source and subsequent trophic transfers, often confounding environmental interpretation. Recently, compound-specific analysis of individual amino acids (δ 15 N-AA) has been shown as a means to deconvolve trophic level versus N source effects on the δ 15 N variability of bulk organic matter. Here, we demonstrate the first use of δ 15 N-AA in a paleoceanographic study, through analysis of annually secreted growth rings preserved in the organic endoskeletons of deep-sea gorgonian corals. In the Northwest Atlantic off Nova Scotia, coral δ 15 N is correlated with increasing presence of subtropical versus subpolar slope waters over the twentieth century. By using the new δ 15 N-AA approach to control for variable trophic processing, we are able to interpret coral bulk δ 15 N values as a proxy for nitrate source and, hence, slope water source partitioning. We conclude that the persistence of the warm, nutrient-rich regime since the early 1970s is largely unique in the context of the last approximately 1,800 yr. This evidence suggests that nutrient variability in this region is coordinated with recent changes in global climate and underscores the broad potential of δ 15 N-AA for paleoceanographic studies of the marine N cycle.},

The dominant dynamic is of kinetic isotope discrimination, in which the light isotope of N (14N) is preferentially converted from substrate to product, leaving the substrate relatively enriched in 15N. The description of models and of observed N fluxes and pools in the ocean is dominated by two general parameters: (1) the amplitude of the isotope discrimination in a given N conversion, and (2) the degree to which that conversion consumes its substrate.},

   volume = {40},
   number = {3},
   pages = {508-523},
   abstract = {Lake food webs are primarily fueled by energy from pelagic, littoral–benthic, and terrestrial habitats. Aquatic consumers acquire C from across these habitats in varying proportions, either directly or by way of consumer–prey transfers along energy pathways. Several factors, including relative habitat availability, allochthonous inputs, and population density, influence consumer use of various basal resources. However, the extent to which these factors interact to control resource use is not well understood. We used mountain lakes in the Cascade Range of western North America to address the question of how different population sizes, along with the relative availability of illuminated benthic habitat and terrestrial influence, determine resource use by Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792). We measured lake bathymetry, light attenuation, and fish catch/unit effort in 16 lakes and analyzed samples of Rainbow Trout muscle tissue, pelagic seston, littoral–benthic periphyton, and terrestrial vegetation for C and N stable isotope ratios. Stable isotope mixing models quantified proportional use of basal resources for each trout. Compositional regression analysis identified how interactions between relative habitat availability and population abundance influence Rainbow Trout use of basal resources. At low population abundance, we found low relative use of terrestrial derived resources with balanced relative use of pelagic and littoral–benthic derived resources. At high abundance, relative use of littoral–benthic derived resources was low, and relative use of terrestrial and pelagic derived resources varied according to habitat availability. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental and biological interactions when considering factors that influence relative resource use in lake ecosystems.},

   abstract = {We used data on nutrients, chlorophyll a (Chla) and submerged macrophyte cover from up to 817 Danish lakes to elucidate seasonal variations in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and to study the impact of N or its role in combination with P. In both deep and shallow lakes, we found marked seasonality in the ratio between total N and total P (TN:TP) and in the inorganic concentrations of nitrogen (DIN), indicating that N more easily becomes a limiting nutrient as summer proceeds. TN:TP reached its lowest values of 7 (by mass) in August in 25% of the shallow lakes. Chla generally related more strongly to TP than to TN, but at high TP concentrations TN explained more of the variability in Chla than TP. Macrophyte cover tended to decrease at increasing TN when TP was between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/l. At macrophyte cover above 20%, Chla was considerably lower compared with lakes with low macrophyte cover. We conclude that P is of key importance for the ecological quality of Danish lakes but that increased N concentrations, particularly in shallow lakes with moderate to high TP, may have significantly adverse effects on lake water quality and ecological status in summer.},

   abstract = {1. The stable isotopes of carbon (12C, 13C) and nitrogen (14N, 15N) represent powerful tools in food web ecology, providing a wide range of dietary information in animal consumers. However, identifying the temporal window over which a consumer's isotopic signature reflects its diet requires an understanding of elemental incorporation, a process that varies from days to years across species and tissue types. 2. Though theory predicts body size and temperature are likely to control incorporation rates, this has not been tested empirically across a morphologically and phylogenetically diverse range of taxa. Readily available estimates of this relationship would, however, aid in the design of stable isotope food web investigations and improve the interpretation of isotopic data collected from natural systems. 3. Using literature-derived turnover estimates from animal species ranging in size from 1 mg to 2000 kg, we develop a predictive tool for stable isotope ecologists, allowing for estimation of incorporation rates in the structural tissues of entirely novel taxa. 4. In keeping with metabolic scaling theory, we show that isotopic turnover rates of carbon and nitrogen in whole organisms and muscle tissue scale allometrically with body mass raised approximately to the power –0·19, an effect modulated by body temperature. This relationship did not, however, apply to incorporation rates in splanchnic tissues, which were instead dependent on the thermoregulation tactic employed by an organism, being considerably faster in endotherms than ectotherms. 5. We believe the predictive turnover equations we provide can improve the design of experiments and interpretation of results obtained in future stable isotopic food web studies.},

   abstract = {Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are used as ecological tracers for a variety of applications, such as studies of animal migrations, energy sources, and food web pathways. Yet uncertainty relating to the time period integrated by isotopic measurement of animal tissues can confound the interpretation of isotopic data. There have been a large number of experimental isotopic diet shift studies aimed at quantifying animal tissue isotopic turnover rate λ (%·day(-1), often expressed as isotopic half-life, ln(2)/λ, days). Yet no studies have evaluated or summarized the many individual half-life estimates in an effort to both seek broad-scale patterns and characterize the degree of variability. Here, we collect previously published half-life estimates, examine how half-life is related to body size, and test for tissue- and taxa-varying allometric relationships. Half-life generally increases with animal body mass, and is longer in muscle and blood compared to plasma and internal organs. Half-life was longest in ecotherms, followed by mammals, and finally birds. For ectotherms, different taxa-tissue combinations had similar allometric slopes that generally matched predictions of metabolic theory. Half-life for ectotherms can be approximated as: ln (half-life) = 0.22*ln (body mass) + group-specific intercept; n = 261, p<0.0001, r2 = 0.63. For endothermic groups, relationships with body mass were weak and model slopes and intercepts were heterogeneous. While isotopic half-life can be approximated using simple allometric relationships for some taxa and tissue types, there is also a high degree of unexplained variation in our models. Our study highlights several strong and general patterns, though accurate prediction of isotopic half-life from readily available variables such as animal body mass remains elusive.},

   abstract = {Non-point source loading of nitrogen and phosphorus is a primary cause of eutrophication of inland waters, although the diffuse and variable nature of nutrient inputs makes it difficult to trace and identify nutrient pathways. Stable nitrogen isotope values (δ15N) in aquatic biota are thought to reflect anthropogenic nutrient inputs, and they may be a promising tool for tracing nutrient sources in watersheds. We measured δ15N of aquatic consumers from a suite of 27 Danish lakes spanning a range of trophic states (oligotrophic to eutrophic) and land uses (forest, urban, agriculture). Primary consumer δ15N values (PCδ 15 N) varied more than 14‰ among lakes. Models of PCδ 15 N were developed from limnological, nitrogen loading, and nitrogen source variables using an information-theoretic approach (Akaike's Information Criteria, AIC). Models based on land use/land cover performed best, indicating that elevated δ15N is not only associated with high nitrogen loading, but is also reflective of nitrogen source. Urban and agricultural land use in the watershed, and particularly within the riparian buffer areas, was quantitatively linked to elevated biotic δ15N.},

   pages = {169-182},
   abstract = {Measurements of δ^sup 15^N of consumers are usually higher than those of their diet. This general pattern is widely used to make inferences about trophic relationships in ecological studies, although the underlying mechanisms causing the pattern are poorly understood. However, there can be substantial variation in consumer-diet δ^sup 15^N enrichment within this general pattern. We conducted an extensive literature review, which yielded 134 estimates from controlled studies of consumer-diet δ^sup 15^N enrichment, to test the significance of several potential sources of variation by means of meta-analyses. We found patterns related to processes of nitrogen assimilation and excretion. There was a significant effect of the main biochemical form of nitrogenous waste: ammonotelic organisms show lower δ^sup 15^N enrichment than ureotelic or uricotelic organisms. There were no significant differences between animals feeding on plant food, animal food, or manufactured mixtures, but detritivores yielded significantly lower estimates of enrichment. δ^sup 15^N enrichment was found to increase significantly with the C:N ratio of the diet, suggesting that a nitrogen-poor diet can have an effect similar to that already documented for fasting organisms. There were also differences among taxonomic classes: molluscs and crustaceans generally yielded lower δ^sup 15^N enrichment. The lower δ^sup 15^N enrichment might be related to the fact that molluscs and crustaceans excrete mainly ammonia, or to the fact that many were detritivores. Organisms inhabiting marine environments yielded significantly lower estimates of δ^sup 15^N enrichment than organisms inhabiting terrestrial or freshwater environments, a pattern that was influenced by the number of marine, ammonotelic, crustaceans and molluscs. Overall, our analyses point to several important sources of variation in δ^sup 15^N enrichment and suggest that the most important of them are the main biochemical form of nitrogen excretion and nutritional status. The variance of estimates of δ^sup 15^N enrichment, as well as the fact that enrichment may be different in certain groups of organisms should be taken into account in statistical approaches for studying diet and trophic relationships.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

   abstract = {Pulsed resource subsidies can have ecological effects that persist over time. These subsidies can be particularly important in aquatic ecosystems, which are often resource-limited. Anadromous salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) deliver annual nutrient pulses to many freshwater ecosystems around the North Pacific. The persistent ecological consequences of this nutrient subsidy are poorly understood across the range of Pacific salmon and likely depend on stream habitat, background nutrient dynamics, and the abundance of spawning salmon. Using a model selection approach, we examined relationships among spawning salmon density, stream habitats, and the abundance and diversity of stream invertebrates ten months after salmon spawning, across 21 streams in central British Columbia, Canada. Total invertebrate abundance increased with salmon density and with higher stream temperatures. Invertebrate diversity was more closely related to stream habitat characteristics than to salmon density. These results suggest that salmon nutrients have a greater impact on stream invertebrate population sizes than on the variety of taxa that inhabit these streams. The three most common invertebrate families-grazing mayflies (Heptageniidae), predatory stoneflies (Chloroperlidae), and chironomid midges (Chironomidae)-all increased in abundance with salmon density. Stream habitat variables (temperature, pH, and substrate size) also explained significant variation in the abundances of the three groups. These results suggest that salmon nutrients retained in the watershed from previous years help support greater abundances of some invertebrate taxa. Thus the pulsed nutrient subsidy provided by spawning salmon may have ecological effects that persist many months, or even years, after it is delivered.},

   abstract = {Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of primary producers and consumers were investigated seasonally throughout 1999, in order to describe the food web in a western Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Lake of Sabaudia, central Italy). Particulate organic matter and algal material (seagrass epiphytes and macroalgae) seem to constitute the main food sources for primary consumers (zooplankton and small benthic invertebrates, respectively) throughout the sampling year, while the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa appears to play a negligible trophic role. As regards the ichthyofauna, carbon stable isotopes differentiated between planktivore and benthivore fish species. However, a benthic–pelagic coupling seems to occur, with some fish of higher trophic levels feeding both on benthic and pelagic materials. Analysis of variance showed that the interaction between the three main factors (species×size×season) significantly affects the isotopic composition of fish, suggesting the presence of intra- and inter-specific resource partitioning. Wide seasonal variations in the isotopic composition were observed in organic matter sources, invertebrates and fish, with a general trend towards depleted values in winter and enriched values in summer. The winter depletion of organic matter sources may be due to several environmental factors and seems to be mirrored in the upper trophic levels. Primary producers and invertebrates are known to have shorter time-integrated isotopic signatures than vertebrates, yet fish also exhibited seasonal isotopic differences. We concluded that the examined fish species can assume a new muscle isotopic signature relatively quickly in response to changes in the isotopic composition of their diet and/or diet shifts.},

   abstract = {We explored δ(15)N compound-specific amino acid isotope data (CSI-AA) in filter-feeding intertidal mussels (Mytilus californianus) as a new approach to construct integrated isoscapes of coastal primary production. We examined spatial δ(15)N gradients in the California Upwelling Ecosystem (CUE), determining bulk δ(15)N values of mussel tissue from 28 sites between Port Orford, Oregon and La Jolla, California, and applying CSI-AA at selected sites to decouple trophic effects from isotopic values at the base of the food web. Bulk δ(15)N values showed a strong linear trend with latitude, increasing from North to South (from ∼ 7‰ to ∼ 12‰, R(2) = 0.759). In contrast, CSI-AA trophic position estimates showed no correlation with latitude. The δ(15)N trend is therefore most consistent with a baseline δ(15)N gradient, likely due to the mixing of two source waters: low δ(15)N nitrate from the southward flowing surface California Current, and the northward transport of the California Undercurrent (CUC), with (15)N-enriched nitrate. This interpretation is strongly supported by a similar linear gradient in δ(15)N values of phenylalanine (δ(15)NPhe), the best AA proxy for baseline δ(15)N values. We hypothesize δ(15)N(Phe) values in intertidal mussels can approximate annual integrated δ(15)N values of coastal phytoplankton primary production. We therefore used δ(15)N(Phe) values to generate the first compound-specific nitrogen isoscape for the coastal Northeast Pacific, which indicates a remarkably linear gradient in coastal primary production δ(15)N values. We propose that δ(15)N(Phe) isoscapes derived from filter feeders can directly characterize baseline δ(15)N values across major biochemical provinces, with potential applications for understanding migratory and feeding patterns of top predators, monitoring effects of climate change, and study of paleo- archives.},

   abstract = {Summary 1. The variability in the stable isotope signatures of carbon and nitrogen (δ13C and δ15N) in different phytoplankton taxa was studied in one mesotrophic and three eutrophic lakes in south‐west Finland. The lakes were sampled on nine to 16 occasions over 2–4 years and most of the time were dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms. A total of 151 taxon‐specific subsamples covering 18 different phytoplankton taxa could be isolated by filtration through a series of sieves and by flotation/sedimentation, followed by microscopical identification and screening for purity. 2. Substantial and systematic differences between phytoplankton taxa, seasons and lakes were observed for both δ13C and δ15N. The values of δ13C ranged from −34.4‰ to −5.9‰ and were lowest in chrysophytes (−34.4‰ to −31.3‰) and diatoms (−30.6‰ to −26.6‰). Cyanobacteria were most variable (−32.4‰ to −5.9‰), including particularly high values in the nostocalean cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (−14.4‰ to −5.9‰). For δ13C, the taxon‐specific amplitude of temporal changes within a lake was usually <1–8‰ (<1–4‰ for microalgae alone and <1–8‰ for cyanobacteria alone), whereas the amplitude among taxa within a water sample was up to 31‰. 3. The values of δ15N ranged from −2.1‰ to 12.8‰ and were high in chrysophytes, dinophytes and diatoms, but low in the nitrogen‐fixing cyanobacteria Anabaena spp., Aphanizomenon spp. and G. echinulata (−2.1‰ to 1.6‰). Chroococcalean cyanobacteria ranged from −1.4‰ to 8.9‰. For δ15N, the taxon‐specific amplitude of temporal changes within a lake was 2–6‰, (2–6‰ for microalgae alone and 2–4‰ for cyanobacteria alone) and the amplitude among taxa within a water sample was up to 11‰. 4. The isotopic signatures of phytoplankton changed systematically with their physical and chemical environment, most notably with the concentrations of nutrients, but correlations were non‐systematic and site‐specific. 5. The substantial variability in the isotopic signatures of phytoplankton among taxa, seasons and lakes complicates the interpretation of isotopic signatures in lacustrine food webs. However, taxon‐specific values and seasonal patterns showed some consistency among years and may eventually be predictable.},

   abstract = {Seasonal oscillations in the carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope signatures of aquatic algae can cause seasonal enrichment–depletion cycles in the isotopic composition of planktonic invertebrates (e.g., copepods). Yet, there is growing evidence that seasonal enrichment–depletion cycles also occur in the isotope signatures of larger invertebrate consumers, taxa used to define reference points in isotope-based trophic models (e.g., trophic baselines). To evaluate the general assumption of temporal stability in non-zooplankton aquatic invertebrates, δ13C and δ15N time series data from the literature were analyzed for seasonality and the influence of biotic (feeding group) and abiotic (trophic state, climate regime) factors on isotope temporal patterns. The amplitude of δ13C and δ15N enrichment–depletion cycles was negatively related to body size, although all size-classes of invertebrates displayed a winter-to-summer enrichment in δ13C and depletion in δ15N. Among feeding groups, periphytic grazers were more variable and displayed larger temporal changes in δ13C than detritivores. For nitrogen, temporal variability and magnitude of directional change of δ15N was most strongly related to ecosystem trophic state (eutrophic > mesotrophic, oligotrophic). This study provides evidence of seasonality in the isotopic composition of aquatic invertebrates across very broad geographical and ecological gradients as well as identifying factors that are likely to modulate the strength and variability of seasonality. These results emphasize the need for researchers to recognize the likelihood of temporal changes in non-zooplankton aquatic invertebrate consumers at time scales relevant to seasonal studies and, if present, to account for temporal dynamics in isotope trophic models.},

These variations are probably governed by the longer trophic transfer lengths in winter than in summer, coupled with a significant difference in δ13C and similar values of δ15N between nanophytoplankton and diatoms. High frequency variations in spring, summer and early autumn were probably caused by the periodic injection of subsurface nitrate by upwelling, which leads to diatom blooms, resulting in heavier δ13C and lighter δ15N in sedimenting POM. Utilization of regenerated ammonium during periods of nutrient depletion could also cause short-term increases in δ15N. At 500m depth, the δ15N value of the POM (c8‰) is heavier than that of the nitrate reservoir (c. 4‰), suggesting that intensive nitrate utilization at the surface and the lateral input of nitrate with lower δ15N from the open ocean are important. POM δ13C data suggest that land input at most comprises 29% of total sedimenting POM.},

   abstract = {Use of stable isotope techniques to quantify food web relationships requires a priori estimates of the enrichment or depletion in δ N and δ C values between prey and predator (known as trophic fractionation; hereafter Δ δ N and Δ δ C). We conducted a broad-scale analysis of Δ δ N and Δ δ C from aquatic systems, including three new field estimates. Carnivores had significantly higher Δ δ N values than herbivores. Furthermore, carnivores, invertebrates, and lab-derived estimates were significantly more variable than their counterparts (f-test, p < 0.00001). Δ δ C was higher for carnivores than for herbivores (p = 0.001), while variances did not differ significantly. Excluding herbivores, the average Δ δ N and Δ δ C were 3.4‰ and 0.8‰, respectively. But even with unbiased fractionation estimates, there is variation in isotopic fractionation that contributes to error in quantitative isotope model outputs. We simulated the error variance in δ N-based estimates of trophic position and two-source δ C diet mixing models, explicitly considering the observed variation in Δ δ N and Δ δ C, along with the other potential error sources. The resultant error in trophic position and mixing model outputs was generally minor, provided that primary consumers were used as baseline indicators for estimating trophic position and that end member δ C values in dietary mixing models were sufficiently distinct.},

   abstract = {We applied a 2-step clustering algorithm and Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to examine intraspecific differences in the contribution of prey sources to the diet and foraging habitat of harbor seals in the Salish Sea, USA. We analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen collected from 32 seals and 248 prey samples representing 18 of 25 of the most common seal prey items identified in seal scat. Stable isotope analyses identified significant harbor seal sex- and size-based differences in diet and foraging habitat use. In comparison to males, female harbor seals had a higher contribution of prey items that were more C-enriched. This result may indicate that females derived more of their δ C value from nearshore versus offshore food webs, an explanation supported by movement data on this population. However, large seals of both sexes displayed a greater offshore signal in their diet, indicating that seal mass effects on foraging habitat use were somewhat independent of sex. Our work contributes to understanding trophic linkages between these generalist consumers and their prey. The foraging differences that we detected between male and female harbor seals present complex challenges for fisheries management and for the design of marine reserves. Many marine reserves in the Pacific Northwest are located in close proximity to seal haul-out sites. By lowering the energetic costs of foraging of females, these reserves may ultimately have the unintended effect of increasing individual fitness, population growth rate, and influencing future predator-induced mortality on endangered species.},

Between 1970 and 2015, we estimate that the annual biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds has increased from 68 to 625 metric tons. Converting juvenile Chinook salmon into adult equivalents, we found that by 2015, pinnipeds consumed double that of resident killer whales and six times greater than the combined commercial and recreational catches. We demonstrate the importance of interspecific interactions when evaluating species recovery. As more protected species respond positively to recovery efforts, managers should attempt to evaluate tradeoffs between these recovery efforts and the unintended ecosystem consequences of predation and competition on other protected species.},

Indeed we show that global fisheries catches since 1950 have been increasingly constrained by the amount of primary production. The primary production appropriated by current global fisheries is 17–112% higher than that appropriated by sustainable fisheries. Global primary production appears to be declining, in some part due to climate variability and change, with consequences for the near future fisheries catches.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have used stable isotope analysis (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen within the bulk tissues of organisms to determine the trophic structure among organisms in a food web. Recently, SIA has evolved to compound‐specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of nitrogen within amino acids to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimated trophic position (TP) of organisms based on the isotopic difference between glutamic acid and phenylalanine within a single organism. However, because the initial offset (β) between glutamic acid and phenylalanine differs between aquatic algae (ca. +3.4‰) and vascular plants (ca. −8.4‰) in food webs that rely on both resources, β should be replaced by a value adapted to the admixture of primary producers for each specimen. In this study, we established a new method involving the β value (βmix) of each consumer specimen determined based on its bulk tissue δ13C value and successfully obtained realistic TPs (TPmix) for organisms in a complex seagrass meadow food web. Remarkable differences between the TPmix and traditional TPalgal values were found in deposit feeders due to the large contribution of seagrass to their basal resources. The estimated TPs of organisms increased by up to 1.5 units (from TPalgal to TPmix), in terms of trophic transfer, when their diets included substantial seagrass‐derived contributions. Thus, combinatorial analysis of the amino acid δ15N and specimen‐specific βmix values provides better understanding of the trophic interactions in food webs, even in complex seagrass meadow ecosystems.},

Bearded seals fed benthically, primarily crustaceans and mollusks. Both zooplankton and fish were significant prey for ringed seals, while fish was principal spotted seal prey. Few gastric contents were available from ribbon seals. δ15N was positively correlated with age in ribbon seals and δ13C was positively correlated with age in ringed and ribbon seals. δ15N was highest in spotted seals, in agreement with their fish-dominated diet. δ15N was not different between Alaskan-harvested ringed and bearded seals, while δ15N was lowest in ribbon seals and walrus. Carbon-13 was most enriched in bearded seals and walrus reflecting benthic ecosystem use. Canadian ringed seals were depleted in 13C compared to Alaskan pinnipeds, likely because of Beaufort Sea versus Chukchi and Bering seas influence.},

   abstract = {Fluctuations in an animal’s trophic position (TP) can indicate changes within an ecosystem. Traditionally, bulk tissue or whole animal nitrogen (N) isotope analysis has been used to determine an animal’s TP, but there are limitations to the application of this approach. Amino acid compound-specific isotope analysis (AA-CSIA) can be used to determine TP based on the difference between the δ N values of certain amino acids, commonly glutamic acid and phenylalanine. The rate at which N is incorporated into amino acids is largely unknown, and this may affect the accuracy of relative TP estimates especially during periods of ecosystem change or ontogenetic changes in diet. To study amino acid turnover rates, the diet of the Pacific white shrimp was changed in the laboratory from an unlabeled diet (7.2‰) to a N-enriched diet (24‰), and animals were sampled over the course of 7 wk. AA-CSIA revealed that turnover times of amino acids vary considerably, with some amino acids having much more rapid turnover than others. The TP of (using δ N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine) over the course of the experiment remained constant, and shrimp TP averaged 2.14 ± 0.15 (mean ± SD, n = 7) relative to its diet, which was as expected. Our results indicate that the δ N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine can be used to accurately determine TP even while shrimp are undergoing a change to a diet with a different δ N value.},

   abstract = {Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the skull bones of South American sea lions Otaria flavescens from the Chubut province (Argentina) were analysed to determine whether their feeding habits change during ontogeny. The stable isotope analysis showed that δ13C steadily increased in males and females with their developmental stage (young, first adult, adult and senile), except in senile males whose δ13C decreased to a value close to that of first adults. Pairwise comparison of bone stable isotope ratio in each developmental stage revealed differences between males and females only for the δ13C values relative to first adults and adults. Overall, results indicate that the contribution of benthic prey items to the diet of both sexes increases with the developmental stage, except in senile males, and that first adult and adult males have a more benthic diet than females at the same developmental stage. No differences exist between males and females at younger and older developmental stages. With respect to δ15N, the only difference was in young female skulls, which were more enriched than those of any other group. Consequently, the trophic level of sea lions is roughly the same throughout life, independent of the developmental stage and sex, except for young females. The growth curve analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the condylobasal length of the skull between the sea lions in both sexes of the young stage and those of the other three developmental stages considered here but not among the individuals of the three later stages. This result indicates that the dietary differences between individuals in the young stage and those in the successive stages is likely due to differences in body size, whereas dietary differences among individuals of the later three stages might be due to different foraging skills that are progressively acquired during their life span.},

   abstract = {Many small pelagic fish species exhibit dramatic fluctuations in abundance accompanied by range expansions during periods of favorable environmental conditions. The location and extent of suitable habitats also shift in response to both short term variability and long term trends in climate. Near the margins of a contemporary range, trends in abundance may reflect a continuation of historical variability but may also foreshadow future changes in distribution. The Salish Sea (all inland marine waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia; made up of the Strait of Georgia, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound) is a highly productive estuarine system at the northern end of the distribution of Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax). An apparent recent (2014–2016) increase in Northern Anchovy abundance has generated interest in the dynamics of this species in the Salish Sea. We compiled recent and historical data to understand spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and fluctuations in abundance over the last century. Spatially-consistent occurrence of eggs, larvae, and juveniles, and year-round presence of multiple age classes, confirm that successful spawning and recruitment of Northern Anchovy occurs within the Salish Sea. Most periods of elevated Northern Anchovy abundance in the last century have corresponded to, or lagged, periods of elevated ocean temperatures. While a 2005 peak in abundance within the Salish Sea also corresponded to higher abundance of Northern Anchovy in adjacent regions of the coastal Pacific Ocean, it seems unlikely that Salish Sea abundance is controlled primarily by advection or migration from external populations. Persistence of elevated ocean temperatures like those observed from 2014 to 2016 could lead to consistently high abundance of Northern Anchovy within the Salish Sea, with implications for trophic relationships and ecosystem function.},

   volume = {27},
   number = {11},
   pages = {2328-2342},
   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial variability of these changes. Understanding how regional‐scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ13C and δ15N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web‐assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production‐nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long‐term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ13C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs. Environmental factors determine resource availability and primary production in marine ecosystems. Stable isotope data from consumer tissues can provide useful indices of nitrogen and carbon resources that are sequestered by primary producers, passed through the food web, and ultimately assimilated into top predators. Based on the stable isotope composition of harbor seal bone specimens from the past century, we determined environmental factors that impact resources assimilated into food webs vary regionally within the northeast Pacific.},

   journal = {Marine ecology. Progress series (Halstenbek)},
   volume = {482},
   pages = {265-277},
   abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (AA) is a rapidly growing tool in ecological studies to assess diet and trophic position (TP) in both modern and ancient foodwebs. We conducted the first controlled feeding study examining δ N values in AAs in a marine mammal (harbor seal ). The pattern of δ N variation among AAs in seals was similar to that observed in other heterotrophs, although exceptions were found with proline and threonine. However, many δ N changes with trophic transfer were very different than those reported for zooplankton and other lower TP marine consumers. In particular the measured trophic enrichment factor (TEF) now broadly used for TP estimation (TEF ) was much lower in harbor seals (~4.3‰) than the current commonly applied value (~7.5‰). Recently published data on wild marine birds (penguins) and elasmobranchs (stingrays) suggests that similar, low TEF values may also be characteristic of these taxa. Together, these data imply that marine mammals and other higher animals have different, but also diagnostic, changes in δ N-AA with trophic transfer vs. organisms examined in previous feeding studies (e.g. zooplankton, bony fish and mollusks), possibly due to dietary protein content, trophic position, and/or form of nitrogen excretion (urea vs. ammonia). Therefore, we propose that for marine mammals, a multi-TEF calculation is required to account for variations of TEF between animals within a food web, and we demonstrate that this approach can predict accurate TP estimates for harbor seals. These results also have significant implication for the application of compound-specific isotope analysis of AAs on terrestrial ecology and trophic structure.},

   abstract = {Disturbance often results in small changes in community structure, but the probability of transitioning to contrasting states increases when multiple disturbances combine. Nevertheless, we have limited insights into the mechanisms that stabilise communities, particularly how perturbations can be absorbed without restructuring (i.e. resistance). Here, we expand the concept of compensatory dynamics to include countervailing mechanisms that absorb disturbances through trophic interactions. By definition, ‘compensation’ occurs if a specific disturbance stimulates a proportional countervailing response that eliminates its otherwise unchecked effect. We show that the compounding effects of disturbances from local to global scales (i.e. local canopy‐loss, eutrophication, ocean acidification) increasingly promote the expansion of weedy species, but that this response is countered by a proportional increase in grazing. Finally, we explore the relatively unrecognised role of compensatory effects, which are likely to maintain the resistance of communities to disturbance more deeply than current thinking allows.},

   volume = {525},
   pages = {153-170},
   abstract = {Coastal ecosystems face a variety of natural and anthropogenic influences, raising questions about mechanisms by which species abundance and composition change over time. We examined these questions by synthesizing 6 surface-trawling efforts in greater Puget Sound, Washington (USA), spanning 40 yr, and then determining changes in forage fish abundance and composition and jellyfish prevalence. We also assessed whether patterns were associated with potential anthropogenic pressures (human population density and commercial harvest) as well as large-scale climate signals. We found evidence for trends in abundance of all forage species in 4 sub-basins of Puget Sound. Cumulative distribution functions of catch per unit effort indicate that the historically dominant forage fishes (Pacific herring and surf smelt) have declined in surface waters in 2 sub-basins (Central and South Puget Sound) by up to 2 orders of magnitude. However, 2 other species (Pacific sand lance and three-spine stickleback) increased in all 4 sub-basins. Consequently, species composition diverged among sub-basins over the last 40 yr. In addition, jellyfish-dominated catches increased 3- to 9-fold in Central and South Puget Sound, and abundance positively tracked human population density across all basins. The strongest predictors of forage fish declines were human population density and commercial harvest. Climate signals offered additional explanatory power for forage fish but not jellyfish catch. These patterns suggest possible linkages between coastal anthropogenic activities (e.g. development, pollution) and the abundance of forage fish and jellyfish in pelagic waters. Our findings also provide a basis for improving indicators for assessment, monitoring, and spatial planning to rehabilitate pelagic ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Recent studies document unprecedented declines in marine top predators that can initiate trophic cascades. Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.},

   pages = {13-29},
   abstract = {In this paper, we focus on 2 mechanisms of cross-boundary food web connectivity in Puget Sound estuaries: passive transport of water-advected organic matter (OM) and active movement of organisms. Both mechanisms serve as potential vectors of food web connectivity, but little research has investigated whether landscape setting changes the dominance of one mechanism over another, or whether the influence of organism movement on food web connectivity can be detected in estuarine systems. We use fish diets, stable isotopes and Bayesian mixing models to identify differences in OM sources assimilated by estuarine fishes, testing whether increased organism mobility or increased fluvial influence results in greater food web connectivity. We compare food web connectivity in 2 different estuaries, one displaying limited freshwater inputs, and the other the terminus of a major river system. Within each estuary, we investigate whether differences in behavioral life history traits correspond to differences in the diets, isotopic signatures and OM assimilation of 2 fish species: bay pipefish , which displays site fidelity to eelgrass beds, and the more transitory juvenile English sole , which moves throughout estuarine deltas during the early demersal growth stage. Our results show water advection plays a dominant role in large-scale OM transport and delivery to adjoining ecosystems in the fluvial estuary, while organism movement provides the more important mechanism of food web connectivity in the estuary exhibiting minor fluvial discharge. However, the 2 mechanisms certainly interact to enhance food web connectivity across estuarine ecotones.},

   abstract = {Two species of hake, Merluccius capensis (MC) and Merluccius paradoxus (MP), together account for most of Namibia’s fisheries catch and they are collectively the most important secondary consumers in the Benguela Current ecosystem. To better resolve their feeding behavior in the northern Benguela Current ecosystem, we examined the size‐specific ontogenetic shift in MC and MP using stable isotopes of δ13C and δ15N as measures of relative source production and trophic level. We also compared hake isotope values to those of their major zooplankton (four species) and nekton (12 species/groups) prey. Results from δ15N showed a significant positive relationship with size in both MC and MP; however, the slopes of the two species were significantly different, with MP displaying a steeper trophic shift. A significant increase in δ13C with size was observed in MC but not MP. In all size classes (except ≤20–29 cm) MC expressed significantly higher δ13C values, generally matching their respective shelf‐slope adult distributions. Relative to zooplankton and nekton prey, smaller hake of both species (20–39 cm) were trophically indistinguishable at a trophic level (TL) of 3.3, indicating predominant zooplanktivory. The largest MC of 60–70 cm had TLs of approximately 3.5–3.6, whereas MP of the same size were slightly higher, at 3.7–3.8 TL, indicating greater piscivory. This is the first spatially and ontogenetically extensive stable isotope analysis of MC and MP in the Benguela Current. Further extension of this analysis throughout the hake range would provide considerable insight into the trophic dynamics of this commercially and ecologically important group.},

Seal numbers began to recover after the cessation of bounties in 1960 and passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) in 1972. From 1978 to 1999, aerial surveys were flown at midday low tides during pupping season to determine the distribution and abundance of harbor seals in Washington. We used exponential and generalized logistic models to examine population trends and size relative to maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and carrying capacity (K). Observed harbor seal abundance has increased 3-fold since 1978, and estimated abundance has increased 7 to 10-fold since 1970. Under National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) management, Washington harbor seals are divided into 2 stocks: coastal and inland waters. The observed population size for 1999 is very close to the predicted K for both stocks. The current management philosophy for marine mammals that assumes a density-dependent response in population growth with MNPL > K/2 is supported by growth of harbor seal stocks in Washington waters.},

Heavily fractionating “trophic” AAs (e.g., glutamic acid: Glu) provide a robust indicator of trophic transfer, while minimally fractionating “source” AAs (e.g., phenylalanine: Phe) closely reflect the δ15N value at the base of the food web (δ15Nbaseline). Together, the CSIA‐AA approach provides an unprecedented ability to disentangle the influences of δ15Nbaseline values and trophic fractionation on consumer nitrogen isotope values. Perhaps the most important assumption underlying CSIA‐AA applications to trophic ecology is that trophic fractionation of Glu and Phe, and thus the trophic discrimination factor TDFGlu‐ Phe (Δ15NGlu − Δ15NPhe), is effectively constant across diverse consumer–resource relationships. To test this assumption, we conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of controlled feeding experiments that examined individual AA trophic fractionation (Δ15NC‐D) and resulting TDFGlu‐ Phe values. We found tremendous variability in TDFGlu‐ Phe values from 0‰ to >10‰ across 70 species (317 individuals) and 88 distinct consumer–diet combinations. However, this variability appears to follow predictable patterns driven by two dominant variables: diet quality and mode of nitrogen excretion. Consumers feeding on high‐quality diets (small diet–consumer AA imbalances) tend to have significantly lower TDFGlu‐ Phe values than consumers feeding on low‐quality diets. Similarly, urea/uric acid‐producing consumers also exhibit significantly lower TDFGlu‐ Phe values than their ammonia‐producing counterparts. While these patterns are certainly not universal, together these factors likely explain many of the observed patterns of TDFGlu‐ Phe variability. We provide an overview of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underpinning AA Δ15NC‐D to explain these patterns. There are several seemingly unique systems, including the remarkably consistent TDFGlu‐ Phe values across insect food webs and the isotopically “invisible” trophic transfers in microbial food webs, that may provide additional insight into the influence of diet quality and nitrogen cycling on AA fractionation. In this review, we argue that to realize the full potential of CSIA‐AA approaches in trophic ecology, we must embrace the variability in TDFGlu‐ Phe values. This likely requires developing new models of trophic transfer dynamics for some applications, including multi‐TDFGlu‐ Phe equations that directly incorporate variability in TDFGlu‐ Phe value.},

   abstract = {Ecological patterns are determined by the interplay between abiotic factors and interactions among species. As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater—albeit less well understood—than direct effects in determining the community- and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology. An improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting species will respond to climate change is imperative if we hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects. ► Temperature affects processes ranging from metabolic rate to population growth rate. ► Species-specific responses to warming generate changes in interactions among species. ► Larger-scale changes include shifts in species ranges and phenological overlap. ► Synthesis of thermal and interspecific effects informs climate change ecology.},

However, it is unknown whether and how warming alters the importance of top-down vs. bottom-up control over community productivity and variability. We performed a 16-month factorial experimental manipulation of warming, nutrient enrichment, and predator presence in replicated freshwater pond mesocosms to test their independent and interactive impacts. Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes.},

Predators, however, do not recognize such restrictions and may be attracted to areas of increased prey abundances where human extraction is being limited. Such targeting by predators may reduce or retard the potential recovery of depressed stocks. In the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound, USA, marine reserves were implemented to recover depressed fish populations. We examine the role of harbor seals in the San Juan Islands food web. We describe the temporal and spatial variability in their diet, emphasizing species for which reserves were established (rockfish spp.) and other important depressed stocks, including salmon spp. and Pacific herring . During winter and spring, seals primarily consumed Pacific herring, Pacific sand lance , northern anchovy , and walleye pollock . During summer/fall, adult salmonids composed >50% of the diet and were particularly important in odd-numbered calendar years, when pink salmon spawn. Rockfish were not a primary prey species at any time of the year, suggesting that the abundance of alternative prey species may reduce predation pressure and provide a critical buffer to rockfish predation. The importance of considering increased visitation by marine predators to areas where potential prey are enhanced through restrictions on human extractions should be considered when modeling the efficacy of quotas and reduced access areas, such as marine reserves.},

   abstract = {Marine mammals have greatly benefitted from a shift from resource exploitation towards conservation. Often lauded as symbols of conservation success, some marine mammal populations have shown remarkable recoveries after severe depletions. Others have remained at low abundance levels, continued to decline, or become extinct or extirpated. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of (1) publicly available population-level abundance data for marine mammals worldwide, (2) abundance trends and recovery status, and (3) historic population decline and recent recovery. We compiled 182 population abundance time series for 47 species and identified major data gaps. In order to compare across the largest possible set of time series with varying data quality, quantity and frequency, we considered an increase in population abundance as evidence of recovery. Using robust log-linear regression over three generations, we were able to classify abundance trends for 92 spatially non-overlapping populations as Significantly Increasing (42%), Significantly Decreasing (10%), Non-Significant Change (28%) and Unknown (20%). Our results were comparable to IUCN classifications for equivalent species. Among different groupings, pinnipeds and other marine mammals (sirenians, polar bears and otters) showed the highest proportion of recovering populations, likely benefiting from relatively fast life histories and nearshore habitats that provided visibility and protective management measures. Recovery was less frequent among cetaceans, but more common in coastal than offshore populations. For marine mammals with available historical abundance estimates (n = 47), larger historical population declines were associated with low or variable recent recoveries so far. Overall, our results show that many formerly depleted marine mammal populations are recovering. However, data-deficient populations and those with decreasing and non-significant trends require attention. In particular, increased study of populations with major data gaps, including offshore small cetaceans, cryptic species, and marine mammals in low latitudes and developing nations, is needed to better understand the status of marine mammal populations worldwide.},

   abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Niño-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: “cool” PDO regimes prevailed from 1890–1924 and again from 1947–1976, while “warm” PDO regimes dominated from 1925–1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations—at a range of varying time scales—can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities—one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years—the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

   abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single‐species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

   abstract = {Pulsed fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can exert top‐down and bottom‐up effects in recipient food webs, through both direct effects on the subsidized trophic levels and indirect effects on other components of the system. While previous theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the influence of allochthonous subsidies on bottom‐up and top‐down processes, understanding how these forces act in conjunction is still limited, particularly when an allochthonous resource can simultaneously subsidize multiple trophic levels. Using the Lake Mývatn region in Iceland as an example system of allochthony and its potential effects on multiple trophic levels, we analyzed a mathematical model to evaluate how pulsed subsidies of aquatic insects affect the dynamics of a soil–plant–arthropod food web. We found that the relative balance of top‐down and bottom‐up effects on a given food web compartment was determined by trophic position, subsidy magnitude, and top predators’ ability to exploit the subsidy. For intermediate trophic levels (e.g., detritivores and herbivores), we found that the subsidy could either alleviate or intensify top‐down pressure from the predator. For some parameter combinations, alleviation and intensification occurred sequentially during and after the resource pulse. The total effect of the subsidy on detritivores and herbivores, including top‐down and bottom‐up processes, was determined by the rate at which predator consumption saturated with increasing size of the allochthonous subsidy, with greater saturation leading to increased bottom‐up effects. Our findings illustrate how resource pulses to multiple trophic levels can influence food web dynamics by changing the relative strength of bottom‐up and top‐down effects, with bottom‐up predominating top‐down effects in most scenarios in this subarctic system.},

Non–dinitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria dominated during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950–1250 Common Era) before giving way to a new regime in which eukaryotic microalgae contributed nearly half of all export production during the Little Ice Age (~1400–1850 Common Era). The third regime, unprecedented in the past millennium, began in the industrial era and is characterized by increasing production by dinitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. This picoplankton community shift may provide a negative feedback to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.},

   abstract = {The Southern Ocean is in an era of significant change. Historic overharvesting of marine mammals and recent climatic warming have cascading impacts on resource availability and, in turn, ecosystem structure and function. We examined trophic responses of sympatric chinstrap ( ) and gentoo ( ) penguins to nearly 100 y of shared environmental change in the Antarctic Peninsula region using compound-specific stable isotope analyses of museum specimens. A century ago, gentoo penguins fed almost exclusively on low-trophic level prey, such as krill, during the peak of historic overexploitation of marine mammals, which was hypothesized to have resulted in a krill surplus. In the last 40 y, gentoo penguin trophic position has increased a full level as krill declined in response to recent climate change, increased competition from recovering marine mammal populations, and the development of a commercial krill fishery. A shifting isotopic baseline supporting gentoo penguins suggests a concurrent increase in coastal productivity over this time. In contrast, chinstrap penguins exhibited no change in trophic position, despite variation in krill availability over the past century. The specialized foraging niche of chinstrap penguins likely renders them more sensitive to changes in krill availability, relative to gentoo penguins, as evinced by their declining population trends in the Antarctic Peninsula over the past 40 y. Over the next century, similarly divergent trophic and population responses are likely to occur among Antarctic krill predators if climate change and other anthropogenic impacts continue to favor generalist over specialist species.},

The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30 degrees S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300).

Changes in numbers of seals since the 1970s were associated with a 74% decrease (95% CI: −85%, −64%) in maximum sustainable yield in Chinook stocks. In contrast, hatchery releases were significantly correlated with Chinook productivity in only one of 20 populations. Our findings are consistent with recent research on predator diets and bioenergetics modeling that suggest there is a relationship between harbour seal predation on juvenile Chinook and reduced marine survival in parts of the eastern Pacific. Forecasting, assessment, and recovery efforts for salmon populations of high conservation concern should thus consider including biotic factors, particularly predator–prey interactions.},

   abstract = {We examine the utility of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope variations to characterize the length of the nursing/lactation period and age at weaning for two northern Pacific otariid species, the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). We used two sampling strategies to measure ontogenetic trends in isotope value, and compared our results to observational data on the reproductive strategies used by these otariids. For Zalophus, we found evidence for 15N enrichment and 13C‐depletion in bone collagen representing the first and second year of growth, which is consistent with the ∼12–14‐mo weaning age in this population after a suitable turnover rate for bone collagen is considered. Analysis of individual tooth annuli from a different suite of Zalophus specimens suggests that half of the individuals were weaned at ∼12 mo of age, and half were dependent on milk for a portion of their second year. For Callorhinus, bone collagen for age classes that contain pre‐weaned individuals were 15N‐enriched, but values were significantly lower in specimens between 6 and 20 mo of age. These 15N‐enriched values, presumably acquired during nursing between 0 and 4 mo of age in Callorhinus, were not present in specimens older than 12 mo of age. Thus complete bone collagen turnover in young‐of‐the‐year occurs in 8–10 mo. 15N enrichment is evident in the first annulus of female Callorhinus individuals, but is not detectable in males. Analyses of Callorhinus tooth annuli show no ontogenetic trends in δ13C values. Our study indicates that nitrogen, and in some cases carbon, isotopes can be used to assess reproductive strategies in marine mammals. When coupled with accurate age estimates based on bone growth regressions, this isotopic technique can be applied to historical or fossil otariids to gain insight into the flexibility of maternal strategies within and across species.},

   abstract = {Estimating trophic structures is a common approach used to retrieve information regarding energy pathways, predation, and competition in complex ecosystems. The application of amino acid (AA) compoundspecific nitrogen (N) isotope analysis (CSIA) is a relatively new method used to estimate trophic position (TP) and feeding relationships in diverse organisms. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of δ¹⁵N AA values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the ¹⁵N enrichment among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and whether inclusion of δ¹⁵N values from multiple AAs improves TP estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe) we found an average value of 6.6 % c across all taxa, which is significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 ‰. We found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the metadata of δ¹⁵N AA values we show that increasing the number of AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual δ¹⁵N AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.},

   abstract = {In light of recent recoveries of marine mammal populations worldwide and heightened concern about their impacts on marine food webs and global fisheries, it has become increasingly important to understand the potential impacts of large marine mammal predators on prey populations and their life-history traits. In coastal waters of the northeast Pacific Ocean, marine mammals have increased in abundance over the past 40 to 50 y, including fish-eating killer whales that feed primarily on Chinook salmon. Chinook salmon, a species of high cultural and economic value, have exhibited marked declines in average size and age throughout most of their North American range. This raises the question of whether size-selective predation by marine mammals is generating these trends in life-history characteristics. Here we show that increased predation since the 1970s, but not fishery selection alone, can explain the changes in age and size structure observed for Chinook salmon populations along the west coast of North America. Simulations suggest that the decline in mean size results from the selective removal of large fish and an evolutionary shift toward faster growth and earlier maturation caused by selection. Our conclusion that intensifying predation by fish-eating killer whales contributes to the continuing decline in Chinook salmon body size points to conflicting management and conservation objectives for these two iconic species.},

   pages = {535-545},
   abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of disturbance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Consequently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturbations within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physically based disturbance (for example, storm, volcanic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dispersal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that describe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or "ecological surprises." In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state. We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century.},

   abstract = {This chapter tests the premise that a single sample from an upper trophic level pelagic predator fish could provide information on both the trophic level of the fish and the δ15N value at the base of the food web. This chapter analyzes the nitrogen isotopic composition of individual amino acids in white muscle tissue (WMT) of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) from the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) to determine if the observed variations in the δ15N values of WMT are primarily controlled by the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the food web or the trophic level of the tuna. The difference between the δ15N values of source and trophic amino acids is used to estimate the trophic level of yellowfin, and this is compared to the estimates based on two independent methods, stomach content analysis and the isotopic difference between the δ15N values of mesozooplankton and yellowfin tuna in the ETP. It is found that nitrogen isotopic analyses of individual amino acids in tuna can be used to distinguish between nutrient and trophic dynamics in pelagic ecosystems, and the implications of these results are discussed for investigating the long-term impact of commercial fishing on the food web structure of marine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {We examined how local- and regional-scale environmental drivers affect patterns of abundance and recruitment in 2 abundant and ecologically significant forage fishes (Pacific herring and surf smelt ) in the Skagit River estuary (Puget Sound, Washington, USA). We identified associations between survey catch rates and environmental conditions at 2 scales: within-season distributional shifts in response to local environmental conditions, and interannual patterns of relative year class strength related to both local- and regional-scale drivers. Using monthly data that spanned a 9 yr period, we found that a small proportion (<2%) of the total deviance in catch rates for both species was related to within-estuary variation in surface water temperature and salinity but that a larger fraction (7 and 12% for Pacific herring and surf smelt, respectively) was explained by interannual variation in recruitment strength. Annual abundance indices for both species were uncorrelated with cumulative river discharge and regional sea surface temperature but positively correlated with an index of cumulative coastal upwelling, suggesting a linkage between regional-scale environmental conditions and age-0 recruitment. Moreover, our annual age-0 Pacific herring time series was positively correlated with a similar time series from the Strait of Georgia (~100 km north), further suggesting that age-0 recruitment in these populations is synchronized by regional upwelling as opposed to estuary-specific environmental forcing related to river flows. The present study isolates a potential key process governing age-0 forage fish abundance in this system and highlights the importance of simultaneously evaluating patterns of variability across multiple spatiotemporal scales in order to identify the primary pathways through which climate may impact estuarine populations.},

This empirical relationship suggests that productivity will decline with global warming. Here, we explore the response of productivity to future climate change in the CCE using an earth system model. This model projects increases in nitrate supply and productivity in the CCE during the 21st century despite increases in stratification and limited change in wind‐driven upwelling. We attribute the increased nitrate supply to enrichment of deep source waters entering the CCE resulting from decreased ventilation of the North Pacific. Decreases in dissolved‐oxygen concentration and increasing acidification accompany projected increases in nitrate. This analysis illustrates that anthropogenic climate change may be unlike past variability; empirical relationships based on historical observations may be inappropriate for projecting ecosystem responses to future climate change.},

   pages = {458-470},
   abstract = {Summary Coasts and estuaries contain among the most productive and ecologically important habitats in the world and face intense pressure from current and projected human activities, including coastal development. Seagrasses are a key habitat feature in many estuaries perceived to be in widespread decline owing to human actions. We use spatio‐temporal models and a 41‐year time series from 100s of km of shoreline which includes over 160 000 observations from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, to examine multiscale trends and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera spp.) change in an urbanizing estuary. At whole estuary scale (100s of km), we find a stable and resilient eelgrass population despite a more than doubling of human population density and multiple major climactic stressors (e.g. ENSO events) over the period. However, the aggregate trend is not reflected at the site scale (10s of km), where some sites persistently increase while others decline. Site trends were spatially asynchronous; adjacent sites sometimes exhibited opposite trends over the same period. Substantial change in eelgrass occurred at the subsite (0·1 km) scale, including both complete local loss and dramatic increase of eelgrass. Metrics of local human development including shoreline armouring, upland development (imperviousness) and human density provide no explanatory power for eelgrass population change at any spatial scale. Our results suggest that the appropriate scale for understanding eelgrass change is smaller than typically assumed (approximately 1‐ to 3‐km scale) and contrasts strongly with previous work. Synthesis. Despite ongoing conservation concern over seagrasses world‐wide, eelgrass in Puget Sound has been highly resilient to both anthropogenic and environmental change over four decades. Our work provides general methods that can be applied to understand spatial and temporal scales of change and can be used to assess hypothesized drivers of change. Changes in eelgrass occurrence occur at local scales as shown in two sites in Puget Sound. Compare 1981–1982 (left column) and 2011–2012 (right column) for two sites. Both areas of complete loss and substantial gain are evident over the scale of just a few kilometers.},

   number = {1},
   pages = {111-125},
   abstract = {Demographic, functional, or habitat diversity can confer stability on populations via portfolio effects (PEs) that integrate across multiple ecological responses and buffer against environmental impacts. The prevalence of these PEs in aquatic organisms is as yet unknown, and can be difficult to quantify; however, understanding mechanisms that stabilize populations in the face of environmental change is a key concern in ecology. Here, we examine PEs in Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasii ) in Puget Sound (USA) using a 40-year time series of biomass data for 19 distinct spawning population units collected using two survey types. Multivariate auto-regressive state-space models show independent dynamics among spawning subpopulations, suggesting that variation in herring production is partially driven by local effects at spawning grounds or during the earliest life history stages. This independence at the subpopulation level confers a stabilizing effect on the overall Puget Sound spawning stock, with herring being as much as three times more stable in the face of environmental perturbation than a single population unit of the same size. Herring populations within Puget Sound are highly asynchronous but share a common negative growth rate and may be influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The biocomplexity in the herring stock shown here demonstrates that preserving spatial and demographic diversity can increase the stability of this herring population and its availability as a resource for consumers.},

   journal = {Marine ecology. Progress series (Halstenbek)},
   volume = {441},
   pages = {225-239},
   abstract = {Evidence suggests that Pacific harbor seals are likely to alter their foraging behavior in response to seasonal prey pulses. We hypothesized that spawning herring aggregations are seasonally important prey for harbor seals, predicting that (1) harbor seal consumption of adult herring would peak during the spawning season, (2) harbor seals would seasonally change their foraging areas to take advantage of spawning herring aggregations, and (3) seal diving behavior would reflect the vertical distribution of herring during the spawning season. The predictions were tested using an analysis of harbor seal prey remains, GPS telemetry, and satellite-linked time/depth recorder data. Contrary to predictions, herring in harbor seal diet was comprised of 74% juveniles and 26% adults in the spawn season, versus 37% juveniles and 63% adults in the post-spawn season. Harbor seal use of documented herring areas was highest during the season when herring did not spawn, and seal diving behavior did not reflect the vertical distribution of herring. The lack of response by harbor seals to spawning herring pulses is likely explained by the low energy density of adult herring during the spawn season, and the availability of profitable alternative prey such as juvenile herring. This study highlights the influence of relative prey profitability on the foraging behavior of harbor seals, and may help to explain why predators do not always respond as predicted to resource pulses.},

   abstract = {Knowing the species and life stages of prey that predators consume is important for understanding the impacts that predation may have on prey populations, but traditional methods for determining diets often cannot provide sufficient detail. We combined data from two methods of scat analysis (DNA metabarcoding and morphological prey ID) to quantify the species and life stages of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) consumed by harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Strait of Georgia, Canada, where juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon survival is poor. Harbour seals primarily consumed adult salmon of lesser conservation concern in the fall (August–November): chum (Oncorhynchus keta: 18.4%), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha: 12.6%), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka: 7.4%), Chinook (7.1%), and coho (1.8%). However, the opposite species trend occurred during the spring when seals preferred juvenile salmon of greater conservation concern (April–July): coho (2.9%), Chinook (2.9%), sockeye (2.5%), pink (1.4%), and chum (0.8%) — percentages that can equate to many individuals consumed. Our data suggest that harbour seals select juveniles of salmon species that out-migrate at ages >1 year and provide evidence of a potential causal relationship between harbour seal predation and juvenile salmon survival trends.},

   volume = {476},
   pages = {237-249},
   abstract = {While many migratory marine organisms converge at breeding areas, identifying foraging strategies away from these reproductive sites can be challenging. Adult female green turtles regularly migrate thousands of kilometers between nesting and foraging areas, making it difficult to identify foraging habitats that support nesting populations and to understand their feeding strategies. In this study, we use stable isotope analysis to investigate the trophic ecology and spatial distribution of foraging green turtles in the Greater Caribbean. Further, we explore the possibility that adult green turtles, originally considered to be herbivores, may, like their counterparts in the Pacific Ocean, display carnivorous feeding strategies. The wide range of carbon and nitrogen isotope values in bulk epidermis observed in the nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, could indicate that these turtles feed over several trophic levels. Isotopic niches—or the range of δ C and δ N values, which can be used as a proxy for ecological niche—varied among the 5 green turtle foraging aggregations sampled. Similarly, the isotopic composition of the primary producer also varied substantially with geographic location. However, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) indicated that individuals in the nesting population with different bulk δ N values feed at the same trophic position. The combined results suggest that spatial differences in the isotopic composition of seagrass at the base of the food web, rather than differences in turtle foraging strategy, contribute to the isotopic variation in the nesting population. This study improves understanding of the foraging ecology of a highly dispersed and migratory species.},

   abstract = {Understanding the variability of foraging behavior within a population of predators is important for determining their role in the ecosystem and how they may respond to future ecosystem changes. However, such variability has seldom been studied in harbor seals on a fine spatial scale (<30 km). We used a combination of standard and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models to explore how environmental variables influenced the dive behavior of harbor seals. Time-depth recorders were deployed on harbor seals from two haul-out sites in the Salish Sea in 2007 (n = 18) and 2008 (n = 11). Three behavioral bout types were classified from six dive types within each bout; however, one of these bout types was related to haul-out activity and was excluded from analyses. Deep foraging bouts (Type I) were the predominant type used throughout the study; however, variation in the use of bout types was observed relative to haul-out site, season, sex, and light (day/night). The proportional use of Type I and Type II (shallow foraging/traveling) bouts differed dramatically between haul-out sites, seasons, sexes, and whether it was day or night; individual variability between seals also contributed to the observed differences. We hypothesize that this variation in dive behavior was related to habitat or prey specialization by seals from different haul-out sites, or individual variability between seals in the study area. The results highlight the potential influence of habitat and specialization on the foraging behavior of harbor seals, and may help explain the variability in diet that is observed between different haul-out site groups in this population.},

   abstract = {The diets and trophic interactions among Weddell, crabeater, Ross, and leopard seals in the eastern Ross Sea, Antarctica, were investigated by the use of stable isotope techniques during the 1999–2000 summer seasons. The δ13C and δ15N values in seal serum clearly distinguished the three Antarctic pack-ice seal species at different trophic positions (Weddell>Ross>crabeater). These patterns appeared to reflect a close linkage to their known foraging ecology and diving behaviors, and agreed well with their presumed dietary diversity. The more enriched δ13C and δ15N values in male Weddell seals than those in females suggested differences in foraging preferences between them. Significant differences in δ15N were also found among different age groups of Weddell seals. A strong correlation between the C:N ratios and serum cholesterol was probably due to extremely high cholesterol levels in phocids. Comparisons of isotope data with harbor seals revealed distinct differences between Antarctic phocids and the northern seal species.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT 1 The western Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus population has experienced a chronic decline since the 1960s. The causes are likely multifactorial and a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors. A draft revised recovery plan for the Steller sea lion has been published by the US National Marine Fisheries Service, listing both anthropogenic and natural factors that may have contributed to the observed decline or which may be a threat to the recovery of the western Steller sea lion population. The purpose of this review is to consider the anthropogenic threats to this stock. 2 Anthropogenic sources of mortality include fisheries competition resulting in nutritional stress, mortality incidental to commercial fisheries (i.e. fisheries by‐catch), subsistence hunts, legal and illegal shooting, commercial hunts, anthropogenic‐related contamination, and research‐induced mortalities. 3 We present evidence that the following anthropogenic factors likely contributed to the decline of the western Steller sea lion population over the last 40 years: (i) mortality incidental to commercial fisheries (i.e. by‐catch); (ii) commercial hunting of western Steller sea lions; and (iii) legal and illegal shooting; whereas the subsistence hunts for western Steller sea lions and mortality incidental to research were not likely to be contributors to the observed decline. 4 Further, we present evidence that the following can be excluded as significant anthropogenic threats to the recovery of the western Steller sea lion population: (i) mortality incidental to commercial fishing; (ii) legal and illegal shooting; (iii) commercial hunts of Steller sea lions; (iv) subsistence hunting; and (v) mortality incidental to research. 5 Competition with fisheries resulting in nutritional stress, and the potential impacts of contaminants, are two anthropogenic factors that should continue to be a priority for the various organizations currently doing research on this population.},

   abstract = {Strongly positive temperature anomalies developed in the NE Pacific Ocean during the boreal winter of 2013–2014. Based on a mixed layer temperature budget, these anomalies were caused by lower than normal rates of the loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and of relatively weak cold advection in the upper ocean. Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are discussed. It is found that sea surface temperature anomalies in this region affect air temperatures downwind in Washington state. Key Points Anomalous atmospheric forcing in the NE Pacific in winter 2013–2014 Weak seasonal cooling due to reduced heat fluxes and anomalous advection SST anomalies have impacts on the ecosystem and air temperatures},

Seals residing in Iliamna Lake, Alaska, are the only known freshwater obligate population of the eastern Pacific harbor seal.},
   abstract = {Human activities threaten the biodiversity of aquatic mammals across the globe. Conservation of these species hinges on the ability to delineate movements and foraging behaviors of animals, but gaining such insights is hampered by difficulties in tracing individuals over their lives. We determined isotope ratios in teeth (87Sr/86Sr, 13C/12C, and 18O/16O) to examine lifelong movement and resource‐use patterns of a unique freshwater population of a wide‐ranging pinniped species (harbor seal [Phoca vitulina]) that resides in Iliamna Lake, Alaska (U.S.A.). This population's potentially unique migratory behavior and use of different trophic resources are unknown. The isotope ratios we measured in teeth showed that seals were born in the lake, remained lifelong residents, and relied principally on resources produced from in the lake, even when seasonally abundant and nutrient‐dense spawning anadromous fish (i.e., sockeye salmon [Oncorhynchus nerka]) were available in the lake. Our results illustrate how serial isotope records in teeth, particularly 87Sr/86Sr ratios, can be used to quantify how coastal mammal populations exploit both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Understanding lifelong patterns of habitat and resource use is essential information when designing effective conservation plans for threatened coastal mammals. We present the Iliamna Lake harbor seals as a unique case study into how isotope records within teeth can help reveal the cryptic ecology of such a population residing in an intact ecosystem. The results also provide critical baseline information for the Kvichak River system, which is facing an uncertain future due to proposed large‐scale industrial development and a rapidly changing climate. Isotopos Dentales y una Población Críptica de Focas Costeras de Agua Dulce Resumen Las actividades humanas amenazan a la diversidad de mamíferos acuáticos en todo el mundo. La conservación de estas especies depende de la habilidad para delinear los movimientos y los comportamientos de búsqueda de alimento de los animales, pero la obtención de dicha información está obstaculizada por las dificultades en el rastreo de individuos a lo largo del transcurso de sus vidas. Determinamos la proporción de isotopos dentales (87Sr/86Sr, 13C/12C y 18O/16O) para examinar el movimiento a lo largo de la vida y los patrones de uso de recursos de una población única de una especie de pinnípedos de agua dulce con una distribución amplia (foca común [Phoca vitulina]), la cual reside en el lago Iliamna, Alaska (E.U.A.). Se desconocen el comportamiento migratorio potencialmente único de esta población y el uso que le dan a los diferentes recursos tróficos. La proporción de isotopos que medimos en los dientes mostró que las focas nacieron en el lago, permanecieron como residentes de toda la vida y dependieron principalmente de los recursos producidos en el lago, incluso cuando estaban disponibles en aquel lugar por razones reproductivas los peces anádromos abundantes estacionalmente y con densidad de nutrientes (es decir, el salmón rojo [Oncorhynchus nerka]). Nuestros resultados ilustran cómo los registros seriales de isotopos dentales, particularmente la proporción 87Sr/86Sr, pueden usarse para cuantificar cómo las poblaciones de mamíferos costeros explotan tanto los ecosistemas marinos como los de agua dulce. El entendimiento de los patrones ontogénicos del uso de recursos y de hábitat es esencial cuando se diseñan planes efectivos de conservación para los mamíferos costeros en peligro. Presentamos a las focas comunes del lago Iliamna como un estudio de caso único sobre cómo los registros de isotopos dentales pueden ayudar a revelar la ecología críptica de dicha población que reside en un ecosistema intacto. Los resultados también proporcionan información importante de línea base para el sistema el río Kvichak, el cual está enfrentando un futuro incierto debido a la propuesta de un desarrollo industrial de gran escala y al rápido clima cambiante. Article Impact statement: Seals residing in Iliamna Lake, Alaska, are the only known freshwater obligate population of the eastern Pacific harbor seal. 摘要 人类活动威胁着全球水生哺乳动物的生物多样性。对这些物种的保护依赖于对它们的移动和觅食行为的认识, 但这却受限于追踪其个体的完整生活史这一难题。我们利用牙齿中的同位素比 （87Sr/86Sr、13C/12C和18O/16O）, 研究了美国阿拉斯加伊利亚姆纳湖广泛分布的一种鳍足动物 （港海豹 Phoca vitulina） 的独特淡水种群在一生中的移动及资源利用格局。此前, 关于这个种群潜在的独特迁徙行为及其对不同营养资源的利用情况尚不清楚。我们通过测定牙齿同位素, 发现这些海豹终生都在伊利亚姆纳湖度过, 主要依赖湖中产生的资源, 即便是在溯河产卵且具有高营养价值的鱼类 （红鲑鱼 Oncorhynchus nerka） 季节性地聚集在湖里时。我们的研究结果表明, 牙齿的连续同位素记录, 特别是87Sr/86Sr 的比值, 可用于定量分析沿海生活的哺乳动物种群对淡水和海洋生态系统的利用情况。在为受胁迫的沿海哺乳动物制定有效保护计划时, 必需了解其一生中对生境和资源的利用格局。本研究以伊利亚特纳湖港海豹作为一个独特的案例, 揭示了牙齿同位素记录如何帮助了解该种群在原生生态系统中神秘的生态学特性。此外, 这些结果也提供了克维查克河生态系统的重要基底信息, 这条河流正受到大规模工业开发计划和剧烈气候变化的影响, 未来充满不确定性。【翻译: 胡怡思; 审校: 聂永刚】},

The isotopic distributions between algae and gastropods and within algal classes are consistent with those in previous reports, suggesting them to be quite useful for studying food web structure.

However, because this “amino acid method” has been constructed from the observations of only a few case studies of food‐consumer combinations in previous studies, the universality of the approach remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the δ15N signatures of amino acids in 17 photoautotrophs and the trophic relationships during four controlled feeding experiments using green algae, zooplankton, and fish. The results are consistent with those reported in previous studies, implying that the amino acid method can be applied to a variety of organisms. From these and previously published data, we estimate the two factors (β, isotope differences among amino acids in primary producers; Δ, the 15N‐enrichment factor for each trophic level) required to calculate the trophic level. Based on the lowest error (1σ = 0.12) in the estimated trophic level, we conclude that a comparison of the δ15N values for glutamic acid and phenylalanine is most useful in calculating precise estimates of the trophic level, using the following equation: trophic level (TLGlu/Phe) = (δ15NGlu − δ15NPhe − 3.4)/7.6 + 1.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have used stable isotope analysis (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen within the bulk tissues of organisms to determine the trophic structure among organisms in a food web. Recently, SIA has evolved to compound‐specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of nitrogen within amino acids to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimated trophic position (TP) of organisms based on the isotopic difference between glutamic acid and phenylalanine within a single organism. However, because the initial offset (β) between glutamic acid and phenylalanine differs between aquatic algae (ca. +3.4‰) and vascular plants (ca. −8.4‰) in food webs that rely on both resources, β should be replaced by a value adapted to the admixture of primary producers for each specimen. In this study, we established a new method involving the β value (βmix) of each consumer specimen determined based on its bulk tissue δ13C value and successfully obtained realistic TPs (TPmix) for organisms in a complex seagrass meadow food web. Remarkable differences between the TPmix and traditional TPalgal values were found in deposit feeders due to the large contribution of seagrass to their basal resources. The estimated TPs of organisms increased by up to 1.5 units (from TPalgal to TPmix), in terms of trophic transfer, when their diets included substantial seagrass‐derived contributions. Thus, combinatorial analysis of the amino acid δ15N and specimen‐specific βmix values provides better understanding of the trophic interactions in food webs, even in complex seagrass meadow ecosystems.},

Location Northeast Pacific; 46–60° N and 125–165° W. Time period From 1998 to 2017 (ongoing). Major taxa studied Zooplankton, with a focus on large herbivores. Methods Approximately 280 summer zooplankton samples were analysed for carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope (SI) ratios. Environmental conditions experienced by zooplankton organisms were extracted from satellite, in situ sensor and model databases. A generalized additive model approach was used to explain the spatial variability of δ13C and δ15N values and to predict isoscapes. Results Sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly (SLA) and chlorophyll‐a concentration emerged as the significant SI predictors. Modelled isoscapes reproduced patterns observed in δ13C and δ15N value distribution, such as a decrease from the coast to offshore. The contribution of eddies in enhancing local production in the open ocean was also well captured by the models. In the central part of the NE Pacific, higher SI values were correlated with higher large copepod biomass measured by the North Pacific Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. However, in the area off the coast of British Columbia, high δ15N variability appeared to be associated with episodic intrusions of coastal waters, demonstrating that caution is needed when interpreting sharp changes in SI ratios. Main conclusions Although the mechanisms driving SI ratio variability are complex, we demonstrate that a few parameters used as a proxy for some of these major mechanisms are able to produce successful isoscape models. This approach was proved useful to provide a qualitative estimate of secondary production, which can be particularly valuable in a region where few data are available.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial variability of these changes. Understanding how regional‐scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ13C and δ15N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web‐assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production‐nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long‐term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ13C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs. Environmental factors determine resource availability and primary production in marine ecosystems. Stable isotope data from consumer tissues can provide useful indices of nitrogen and carbon resources that are sequestered by primary producers, passed through the food web, and ultimately assimilated into top predators. Based on the stable isotope composition of harbor seal bone specimens from the past century, we determined environmental factors that impact resources assimilated into food webs vary regionally within the northeast Pacific.},

   pages = {31-54},
   abstract = {IntroductionThe ways in which productivity, stability, population interactions, and community structure are regulated in ecosystems have been a central focus of ecology for over a century. At large spatial scales, major insights into these dynamics have been principally derived from analyses of changes induced from hunting, harvesting, and agricultural practices – so-called “natural experiments.” In terrestrial ecosystems estimates of the fraction of land transformed or degraded by human activity fall within the range of 39 to 75% (Vitousek et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2010). Equally profound is the reality that up to 75% of the global oceans and in particular the continental shelf, transitional slope water areas, and reef habitats have been strongly impacted by human activity (Halpern et al., 2008).One of the most widely studied human impacts has been the over-exploitation of large-bodied species. Berger et al. (2001) estimated that the spatial distribution of large mammalian carnivores that once played a dominant role in terrestrial ecosystems has declined by 95–99%. In the global oceans large predatory fish biomass may be as low as 10% of pre-industrial levels (Myers and Worm, 2003). These changes have created a vertical compaction and blunting of the trophic pyramid (Duffy, 2003; Chapter 14, this volume). On a global scale, these losses are attributable to a positive association between body size and sensitivity to population declines experienced by larger species which exhibit a greater susceptibility to decline or collapse as a consequence of their lower population densities, greater times to maturity, lower clutch sizes, and larger home ranges (Schipper et al., 2008). This reduction in the abundance of apex predators has led to abnormally high densities of their former prey in a wide range of ecosystems, which has, in turn, resulted in sometimes catastrophic changes in the ecosystems occupied. This has led some to conclude that large-bodied species are essential to the maintenance of ecosystem structure and stability (Hildrew et al., 2007; Estes et al., 2011).},

   abstract = {Compound‐specific stable isotope analysis of individual amino acids (CSIA‐AA) has emerged as a transformative approach to estimate consumer trophic positions (TPCSIA) that are internally indexed to primary producer nitrogen isotope baselines. Central to accurate TPCSIA estimation is an understanding of beta (β) values—the differences between trophic and source AA δ15N values in the primary producers at the base of a consumers’ food web. Growing evidence suggests higher taxonomic and tissue‐specific β value variability than typically appreciated. This meta‐analysis fulfils a pressing need to comprehensively evaluate relevant sources of β value variability and its contribution to TPCSIA uncertainty. We first synthesized all published primary producer AA δ15N data to investigate ecologically relevant sources of variability (e.g. taxonomy, tissue type, habitat type, mode of photosynthesis). We then reviewed the biogeochemical mechanisms underpinning AA δ15N and β value variability. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivity of TPCSIA estimates to uncertainty in mean βGlx‐Phe values and Glx‐Phe trophic discrimination factors (TDFGlx‐Phe). We show that variation in βGlx‐Phe values is two times greater than previously considered, with degree of vascularization, not habitat type (terrestrial vs. aquatic), providing the greatest source of variability (vascular autotroph = −6.6 ± 3.4‰; non‐vascular autotroph = +3.3 ± 1.8‰). Within vascular plants, tissue type secondarily contributed to βGlx‐Phe value variability, but we found no clear distinction among C3, C4 and CAM plant βGlx‐Phe values. Notably, we found that vascular plant βGlx‐Lys values (+2.5 ± 1.6‰) are considerably less variable than βGlx‐Phe values, making Lys a useful AA tracer of primary production sources in terrestrial systems. Our multi‐trophic level sensitivity analyses demonstrate that TPCSIA estimates are highly sensitive to changes in both βGlx‐Phe and TDFGlx‐Phe values but that the relative influence of β values dissipates at higher trophic levels. Our results highlight that primary producer β values are integral to accurate trophic position estimation. We outline four key recommendations for identifying, constraining and accounting for β value variability to improve TPCSIA estimation accuracy and precision moving forward. We must ultimately expand libraries of primary producer AA δ15N values to better understand the mechanistic drivers of β value variation.},

A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend‐count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long‐term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short‐term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.},

We analyze a unique, fishery-independent data set of North Pacific seabird tissues to inform ecosystem trends over 13 decades (1890s to 2010s). Trophic position declined broadly in five of eight species sampled, indicating a long-term shift from higher-trophic level to lower-trophic level prey. No species increased their trophic position. Given species prey preferences, Bayesian diet reconstructions suggest a shift from fishes to squids, a result consistent with both catch reports and ecosystem models. Machine learning models further reveal that trophic position trends have a complex set of drivers including climate, commercial fisheries, and ecomorphology. Our results show that multiple species of fish-consuming seabirds may track the complex changes occurring in marine ecosystems.},

This paper shows the comparison of qualitative composition of amino acids of fish skin (FS) collagen, bovine Achilles tendon (BAT) collagen, and bone collagen. Results demonstrate that FS collagen as well as BAT collagen contains no cysteine and significantly different amount of hydroxyproline. In BAT collagen hydroxyproline content is 30% higher than hydroxyproline content of FS collagen. In bone collagen the amount of hydroxyproline is two times more than in FS collagen.

   abstract = {The nutritional profile of harbor seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758) diets was determined from scats using a new diet formulation software program and a prey nutritional database developed from proximate analyses of various prey found in Alaskan waters. Scats were collected from Tugidak Island, Alaska, during summers from 2001 to 2009 and prey composition of the diet was estimated using split-sample frequency of occurrence (ssFO) and biomass reconstruction (BR). While 60 different prey items were identified across the collection period, only 21 were found in >10% of scats during at least one sampling period, and an average of 2.6 prey species were identified per scat. Diet diversity was consistently lower in the breeding season than in the molting season. The estimated relative importance of some prey items was significantly different between methods; however, there were no significant differences in the overall estimated protein, lipid, or gross energy composition of the diets. The diet formulation software allows evaluation of the nutritional composition of free-ranging diets using the non-invasive collection of scat. Results from combining the prey database and nutritional composition of diets across years suggest that harbor seals have flexible diets and can maintain nutritional input by taking advantage of seasonally or periodically abundant prey. •Diets estimated using two different diet reconstruction indices were compared.•Nutritional content was estimated using a prey nutritional database.•Diet diversity was consistently lower in the breeding versus molting seasons.•Despite changes in prey consumed, nutritional composition was relatively constant.•Harbor seals can maintain nutritional input despite change in prey availability.},

   abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (AA) is a rapidly growing tool in ecological studies to assess diet and trophic position (TP) in both modern and ancient foodwebs. We conducted the first controlled feeding study examining δ N values in AAs in a marine mammal (harbor seal ). The pattern of δ N variation among AAs in seals was similar to that observed in other heterotrophs, although exceptions were found with proline and threonine. However, many δ N changes with trophic transfer were very different than those reported for zooplankton and other lower TP marine consumers. In particular the measured trophic enrichment factor (TEF) now broadly used for TP estimation (TEF ) was much lower in harbor seals (~4.3‰) than the current commonly applied value (~7.5‰). Recently published data on wild marine birds (penguins) and elasmobranchs (stingrays) suggests that similar, low TEF values may also be characteristic of these taxa. Together, these data imply that marine mammals and other higher animals have different, but also diagnostic, changes in δ N-AA with trophic transfer vs. organisms examined in previous feeding studies (e.g. zooplankton, bony fish and mollusks), possibly due to dietary protein content, trophic position, and/or form of nitrogen excretion (urea vs. ammonia). Therefore, we propose that for marine mammals, a multi-TEF calculation is required to account for variations of TEF between animals within a food web, and we demonstrate that this approach can predict accurate TP estimates for harbor seals. These results also have significant implication for the application of compound-specific isotope analysis of AAs on terrestrial ecology and trophic structure.},

   abstract = {This study assessed the summer diet and consumption patterns of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) resident in Iliamna Lake, Alaska. The authors predicted that adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a seasonally abundant and nutrient-rich prey source, would dominate diets when available and that seals would preferentially consume the most energetically profitable portion of salmon carcasses. Diet was examined by identifying hard parts of prey found in harbor seal scats, and consumption patterns were measured by collecting carcasses of harbor seal-killed sockeye salmon along island spawning grounds. Salmonids were present in 98% of scats that contained identifiable prey, followed by petromyzontids, osmerids, cottids, coregonids, and gasterosterids. The carcass surveys provided evidence of selective consumption patterns of sockeye salmon body parts. Harbor seals consumed the bodies of nearly all (96.6%) male salmon collected, leaving little but the head. In contrast, the belly and eggs were consumed in 63.6% of the female samples, and the entire body was eaten in only 31.3% of females. The harbor seals in Iliamna Lake thus took advantage of the seasonally abundant adult sockeye salmon by consuming them selectively and as a high proportion of their diet, but they also consumed smaller resident fishes, which presumably sustain them during the rest of the year.},

Structured within lake systems, individual populations display diverse life history characteristics and local adaptations to the variation in spawning and rearing habitats. This biocomplexity has enabled the aggregate of populations to sustain its productivity despite major changes in climatic conditions affecting the freshwater and marine environments during the last century.

   pages = {591-601},
   abstract = {Sea lion and seal populations in Alaskan waters underwent various degrees of decline during the latter half of the twentieth century and the cause(s) for the declines remain uncertain. The stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope ratios in bone collagen from wild Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska were measured for the period 1951–1997 to test the hypothesis that a change in trophic level may have occurred during this interval and contributed to the population declines. A significant change in δ15N in pinniped tissues over time would imply a marked change in trophic level. No significant change in bone collagen δ15N was found for any of the three species during the past 47 years in either the Bering Sea or the Gulf of Alaska. However, the 15N in the Steller sea lion collagen was significantly higher than both northern fur seals and harbor seals. A significant decline in δ13C (almost 2 ‰ over the 47 years) was evident in Steller sea lions, while a declining trend, though not significant, was evident in harbor seals and northern fur seals. Changes in foraging location, in combination with a trophic shift, may offer one possible explanation. Nevertheless, a decrease in δ13C over time with no accompanying change in δ15N suggests an environmental change affecting the base of the foodweb rather than a trophic level change due to prey switching. A decline in the seasonal primary production in the region, possibly resulting from decreased phytoplankton growth rates, would exhibit itself as a decline in δ13C. Declining production could be an indication of a reduced carrying capacity in the North Pacific Ocean. Sufficient quantities of optimal prey species may have fallen below threshold sustaining densities for these pinnipeds, particularly for yearlings and subadults who have not yet developed adequate foraging skills.},

   abstract = {We measured stable‐nitrogen (δ15N) and stable‐carbon (δ13C) isotope ratios in muscle and hair from 7 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and 27 Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and 14 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from the Gulf of Alaska and coast of Washington State, in order to contrast dietary information derived from isotopic vs. available conventional dietary studies. Stable‐nitrogen‐isotope analysis of muscle revealed that harbor seals were enriched over sea lions (mean δ15N = 18.6‰vs. 17.5‰) which were in turn enriched over northern fur seals (mean δ15N = 16.6‰). Trophic segregation among these species likely results primarily from differential reliance on herring (Clupea harengus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and large vs. small walleye pollock (Theregra chalcogramma). According to their δ15N values, adult male Steller sea lions showed a higher trophic position than adult females (mean δ15N: 18.0‰vs. 17.2‰), whereas adult female northern fur seals were trophically higher than juvenile male fur seals (mean δ15N: 16.5‰vs. 15.0‰). Each of these observed differences likely resulted from differential reliance on squid or differences in the size range of pollock consumed. Three northern fur seal pups showed higher δ15N enrichment over adults (mean 17.7‰vs. 15.8‰) due to their reliance on their mother's milk. Stable‐carbon isotope measurements of hair revealed a cline toward more negative values with latitude. Segregation in hair δ13C between Steller sea lions and harbor seals off the coast of Washington (mean δ13C: −13.6‰vs.−15.0‰) reflected the greater association of harbor seals with freshwater input from the Columbia River. Our study demonstrates the utility of the stable isotope approach to augment conventional dietary analyses of pinnipeds and other marine mammals.},

   abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

   abstract = {Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are an ecologically, commercially, and culturally important Alaskan groundfish species. Commercial harvest of halibut dates back to the late 19th century and has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) since 1921. IPHC surveys have revealed declining trends in survey biomass in multiple regions and region‐specific declines in mean size‐at‐age (size‐at‐age) over the past two decades (>50% in some areas). Changes in size‐at‐age can arise from a variety of physical, ecological, sampling, and fishery effects, including size‐dependent fishery or predation mortality, alteration in growth from variability in prey quality or quantity, and changes in temperature‐dependent metabolic demands. Here, we develop and apply a bioenergetics model for halibut using survey‐based diet and temperature data for Alaska to evaluate potential environmental drivers of size‐at‐age. In general, juvenile (<40 cm fork length) foraging rates were highest in the Gulf of Alaska concomitant with higher potential growth and elevated basal metabolic demands during warm summer conditions. In contrast, adult (40–120 cm FL) potential growth was highest in the Eastern Bering Sea, potentially reflecting lower metabolic costs and higher rates of prey consumption in that region. We additionally find evidence for interannual variation in potential growth, with a higher frequency of reduced growth potential in the last decade, particularly in the Eastern Bering Sea in 2015 and 2016 for both juvenile and adult halibut. These results suggest the potential for patterns in size‐at‐age to arise from trophic and environmental constraints that collectively limit growth in some regions and years.},

This update incorporates a new release of ICOADS release 3.0 (R3.0), a decade of near-surface data from Argo floats, and a new estimate of centennial sea ice from HadISST2. A number of choices in aspects of quality control, bias adjustment, and interpolation have been substantively revised. The resulting ERSST estimates have more realistic spatiotemporal variations, better representation of high-latitude SSTs, and ship SST biases are now calculated relative to more accurate buoy measurements, while the global long-term trend remains about the same. Progressive experiments have been undertaken to highlight the effects of each change in data source and analysis technique upon the final product. The reconstructed SST is systematically decreased by 0.077°C, as the reference data source is switched from ship SST in ERSSTv4 to modern buoy SST in ERSSTv5. Furthermore, high-latitude SSTs are decreased by 0.1°–0.2°C by using sea ice concentration from HadISST2 over HadISST1. Changes arising from remaining innovations are mostly important at small space and time scales, primarily having an impact where and when input observations are sparse. Cross validations and verifications with independent modern observations show that the updates incorporated in ERSSTv5 have improved the representation of spatial variability over the global oceans, the magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events, and the decadal nature of SST changes over 1930s–40s when observation instruments changed rapidly. Both long-(1900–2015) and short-term (2000–15) SST trends in ERSSTv5 remain significant as in ERSSTv4.},

   abstract = {Fatty acid signature analysis was used to investigate the diet and the spatial scales of foraging in harbor seals Phoca vitulina richardsi in Prince William Sound (PWS) and elsewhere in the Gulf of Alaska. Blubber samples collected in 1994 and 1995 from 104 harbor seals from PWS, Kodiak Island, and southeast Alaska were analyzed for fatty acid composition. A total of 163 potential prey samples representing 10 taxa were collected and individually analyzed for total fat content and fatty acid composition. Approximately 70 fatty acids and isomers were found in both harbor seals and their prey. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to classify seals and prey according to their fatty acid signatures. Large differences were found in the fatty acid composition of blubber from seals sampled at Kodiak, southeast Alaska and PWS, over a broad geographical scale of 400 to 800 km. Additionally, fatty acid signatures distinguished seals from different regions within PWS, as well as on finescale resolutions of specific haulout sites within 9 to 15 km of one another. These findings suggest that seals forage site-specifically. These conclusions are supported by prey fatty acid patterns, which also differed on similarly small spatial scales within PWS. Not only could prey species such as herring Clupea pallasi and pollock Theragra chalcogramma be differentiated from one another using fatty acid signatures, but they could also be distinguished by size-class and location within PWS, reflecting differences in diet with age and as well as with fine-scale habitat. Results from this study are consistent with both satellite data from tagged harbor seals and stomach content analyses of forage fish species in PWS. Although preliminary, analyses suggest that large herring and pollock, as well as flatfish, may have dominated the diet of seals in southern PWS, whereas diets of seals in northern and eastern PWS may have been comprised more of small size classes of herring and pollock, and perhaps other items such as cephalopods, sandlance Ammodytes hexapterus, cod Gadus macrocephalus, and shrimp. We conclude that fatty acid signature analysis will be an important contribution to understanding marine food webs in estuarine and other marine environments.},

Chronic disturbance from ships, however subtle, could impact long‐term population stability. We examined variation in abundance and distribution of harbor seals on floating ice in Disenchantment Bay, Alaska, a tour ship destination for over a century with near daily visitation by ships in the spring/summer over the last decade. Counts of seals by aerial transect showed a sharp decline in May, prior to pupping and the first ships arriving; counts rebounded by the end of June remaining high until August. Seal distribution and abundance peaked in 5–7 tenths ice cover; total area of ice cover showed no effect. Despite regular flushing of seals by ships, we found no broad‐scale patterns in seal abundance and distribution that could be explained by ship presence. We cannot rule out mechanisms of long‐term disturbance, difficult to detect and that might explain notable differences with other, similar sites. Population declines at disturbed glacial sites and the still rising popularity of vessel‐based tourism indicate a need for individual‐based studies on how seals respond to the dynamics of glacial ice environments and human‐caused stresses.},

   abstract = {Recovery of severely declining resource stocks often leads to enforced quotas or reduced human access to those resources. Predators, however, do not recognize such restrictions and may be attracted to areas of increased prey abundances where human extraction is being limited. Such targeting by predators may reduce or retard the potential recovery of depressed stocks. In the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound, USA, marine reserves were implemented to recover depressed fish populations. We examine the role of harbor seals in the San Juan Islands food web. We describe the temporal and spatial variability in their diet, emphasizing species for which reserves were established (rockfish spp.) and other important depressed stocks, including salmon spp. and Pacific herring . During winter and spring, seals primarily consumed Pacific herring, Pacific sand lance , northern anchovy , and walleye pollock . During summer/fall, adult salmonids composed >50% of the diet and were particularly important in odd-numbered calendar years, when pink salmon spawn. Rockfish were not a primary prey species at any time of the year, suggesting that the abundance of alternative prey species may reduce predation pressure and provide a critical buffer to rockfish predation. The importance of considering increased visitation by marine predators to areas where potential prey are enhanced through restrictions on human extractions should be considered when modeling the efficacy of quotas and reduced access areas, such as marine reserves.},

But modelling spatial relationships, especially in large point data sets, presents major computational challenges. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach, ‘spatial predictive process’ modelling, to predict the distribution of a major invasive plant species, Celastrus orbiculatus, in the northeastern USA. The model runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional geostatistical models on a large data set of c. 4000 points, and performs better than generalized linear models, generalized additive models and geographically weighted regression in cross‐validation. We also use this approach to model simultaneously the distributions of a set of four major invasive species in a spatially explicit multivariate model. This multispecies analysis demonstrates that some pairs of species exhibit negative residual spatial covariation, suggesting potential competitive interaction or divergent responses to unmeasured factors.},

Here we test the hypothesis that relationships among environmental and community time series are nonstationary in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem (North Pacific Ocean) over multidecadal time scales. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is applied to environmental and community data from before and after 1988/1989, corresponding to the timing of an abrupt decline in temporal variance of the Aleutian Low atmospheric pattern, a leading driver of Gulf of Alaska climate. Results show that covariance among local atmosphere and ocean environmental variables weakened simultaneous to the decline in Aleutian Low variance. At the same time, community‐wide responses of 14 fish and crustacean populations to physical forcing weakened, as indicated by nonstationary environment–biology regression coefficients. In line with theoretical predictions, this loss of a shared response to environmental variability was accompanied by weakening community covariance. Individual populations also showed nonstationary relationships with shared trends of community variability. We conclude that assumptions of fixed environmental and community relationships are likely to produce mistaken inference in this ecosystem. Similar concerns may apply in other ecosystems subject to changing climate patterns.},

   abstract = {Climate change is likely to change the relationships between commonly used climate indices and underlying patterns of climate variability, but this complexity is rarely considered in studies using climate indices. Here, we show that the physical and ecological conditions mapping onto the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index have changed over multidecadal timescales. These changes apparently began around a 1988/1989 North Pacific climate shift that was marked by abrupt northeast Pacific warming, declining temporal variance in the Aleutian Low (a leading atmospheric driver of the PDO), and increasing correlation between the PDO and NPGO patterns. Sea level pressure and surface temperature patterns associated with each climate index changed after 1988/1989, indicating that identical index values reflect different states of basin-scale climate over time. The PDO and NPGO also show time-dependent skill as indices of regional northeast Pacific ecosystem variability. Since the late 1980s, both indices have become less relevant to physical-ecological variability in regional ecosystems from the Bering Sea to the southern California Current. Users of these climate indices should be aware of nonstationary relationships with underlying climate variability within the historical record, and the potential for further nonstationarity with ongoing climate change.},

Seals were tracked for a total of 5,517 seal‐days and were located on about 80% of the days that tags transmitted. Most locations were in or near PWS, but some juvenile seals moved 300–500 km east and west into the Gulf of Alaska. While several seals travelled to 50–100 km offshore, virtually all locations were in water <200 m deep. Overall, juvenile seals moved more than adults and had larger home ranges. Movements were significantly affected by month, and age by month and sex by month interactions. In all months, mean distances between successively used haulouts were <10 km for adults and <20 km for juveniles. Mean monthly home ranges varied from <100 km2 to >1,500 km2, and were smallest during June‐July. Mean haul‐out to at‐sea distance was 5–10 km for adults and generally 10–25 km for juveniles. Satellite‐linked tags provided an effective means of monitoring and describing the full range of harbor seal movements in this region, with the exception of late summer when tags were shed during the molt.},

Perinatal periods were long (≥10.0 days); although varied between years. Timing of parturition was earlier and perinatal periods longer for multiparous females compared to females considered to be primiparous. Summer foraging trip durations were short (X̄ = 16.5 h), increased during August, then did not change significantly over the course of the autumn (X̄ = 55.7 h). Individual lactating females spent a greater proportion of their time on shore during the summer and a greater proportion of their time at sea during the autumn. The amount of time that females nursed their pups also increased significantly from the summer to autumn. Long perinatal periods and short foraging trips during summer indicate that sea lions are likely finding sufficient food nearby. Our data also ...},

   abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotope ratios of whole organisms and tissues are routinely used in studies of trophic relationships and nitrogen flow through ecosystems, yet changes underlying increases in δ15N from food source to consumer are not completely understood. In this study, the δ15N of 16 amino acids in marine planktonic consumers and their food sources were examined using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry of their N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester derivatives. Moderate increases in bulk δ15N with trophic position reflect an averaging of large increases in the δ15N of some amino acids, and little or no change in others. Amino acids showing consistently large increases (e.g., glutamic acid changes by ~7‰ between food and consumer) provide greater scope for defining trophic position than the smaller isotopic changes in bulk material. In contrast, amino acids like phenylalanine show no change in δ15 N with trophic position and therefore preserve information about nitrogen sources at the base of the food web. The ability to acquire information about both trophic level and nitrogen sources at the base of the food web from single samples of consumer tissues offers a powerful new tool for elucidating pathways of N transfer through food webs.},

   abstract = {One explanation for recent declines in the Alaskan Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) population is that the availability of preferred prey has changed. Part of our evaluation of this hypothesis involved the use of conventional radio and satellite-linked time-depth recorder transmitters to compare summer and winter foraging of adult female and young-of-the-year Steller sea lions in Alaska waters. Foraging effort was not significantly different seasonally for postpartum adult females, though females with dependent young in winter may increase their foraging effort. In winter, all adult females made longer trips over larger home ranges and dove deeper. Young sea lions exerted less foraging effort, had the shallowest and briefest dives, and had home ranges intermediate in size to the two groups of adult females. Their foraging ability appears to develop throughout the first year. We conclude that adult female sea lions can exploit prey throughout the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, and are constrained only by their reproductive status and seasonal changes in prey availability. Young sea lions' diving is more limited because their physiological and behavioral development constrains them from diving like an adult. Perhaps most important, dives remain shallow through the first year. Consequently, young sea lions could be more easily food-limited by changes in prey distribution.},

Gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry was applied to investigate whether lysine of intestinal origin is available for body protein synthesis. Two minipigs with an end‐to‐end ileorectal anastomosis received orally equimolar amounts of 15N as ammonium chloride or urea twice a day for 10 days. Samples of blood and ileal digesta were collected before and throughout the 10 days; tissue samples were taken at termination of the experiment. The N‐acetyl‐n‐propyl (NAP)‐ and N‐pivaloyl‐i‐propyl (NPP)‐amino acid esters were evaluated for the determination of the 15N content of lysine and 16 other amino acids ranging from natural abundance to an enrichment of 0.6 APE 15N in a complex mixture of proteinogenic amino acids and several matrices. At natural abundances for all amino acids analysed, NAP and NPP derivatives gave mean precisions of 0.5 and 0.3‰ δ15N, respectively. The mean precision for NPP derivatives at enrichments between 0.42 and 1.10 AP 15N ranged between 1.0–15.0‰ δ15N. 15N from ammonium chloride was incorporated into lysine and in all other amino acids of serum albumin to a 2.5 times higher degree than from urea. Somewhat lower, but significant, lysine enrichments were detected in liver, duodenum and jejunum. After 10 days of ingestion of 15N‐labeled urea a significant 15N enrichment in lysine of serum albumin could not be detected, although lysine in the ileal digesta was significantly labeled by day 5. This is the first report providing evidence that the microflora in the upper gastrointestinal tract of pigs is capable of synthesizing lysine de novo and that this lysine is available for body protein synthesis.},

   abstract = {The relative importance of environmental and intrinsic controls on recruitment in fishes has been studied for over a century. Despite this, we are not much closer to predicting recruitment. Rather, recent analyses suggest that recruitment is virtually independent of stock size and, instead, seems to occur in distinct environmental regimes. This issue of whether or not recruitment and subsequent production are coupled to stock size is highly relevant to management. Here, we apply empirical dynamical modelling (EDM) to a global database of 185 fish populations to address the questions of whether or not variation in recruitment is (a) predictable and (b) coupled to stock size. We find that a substantial fraction of recruitment variation is predictable using only the observed history of fluctuations (~40% on average). In addition, although recruitment is often coupled to stock size (107 of 185 stocks), stock size alone explains very little of the variation in recruitment; In ~90% of the stocks analysed, EDM forecasts have substantially lower prediction error than models based solely on stock size. We find that predictability varies across taxa and improves with the number of generations that have been sampled. In the light of these results, we suggest that EDM will be of greatest use in managing relatively short‐lived species.},

   abstract = {Estimating trophic structures is a common approach used to retrieve information regarding energy pathways, predation, and competition in complex ecosystems. The application of amino acid (AA) compoundspecific nitrogen (N) isotope analysis (CSIA) is a relatively new method used to estimate trophic position (TP) and feeding relationships in diverse organisms. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of δ¹⁵N AA values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the ¹⁵N enrichment among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and whether inclusion of δ¹⁵N values from multiple AAs improves TP estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe) we found an average value of 6.6 % c across all taxa, which is significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 ‰. We found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the metadata of δ¹⁵N AA values we show that increasing the number of AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual δ¹⁵N AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.},

   abstract = {•This review investigates the sources, cycling, and trophic modification of nitrogen.•δ15N values of amino acids are useful for estimating trophic positions of organisms.•The δ15N value of phenylalanine indicates the δ15N baseline of the food web. Compound-specific isotopic analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) has emerged in the last decade as a powerful approach for tracing the origins and fate of nitrogen in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This approach is based on the empirical observation that source amino acids (SAAs) (i.e., phenylalanine), fractionate 15N very little (< 0.5‰) during trophic transfer, whereas trophic AAs (TAAs) (i.e., glutamic acid), are greatly (∼6–8‰) enriched in 15N during each trophic step. The differential fractionation of these two AA groups can provide a valuable estimate of consumer trophic position that is internally indexed to the baseline δ15N value of the integrated food web. In this paper, we critically review the analytical methods for determining the nitrogen isotopic composition of AAs by gas chromatography–isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We also discuss methodological considerations for accurate trophic position assessment of organisms using CSIA-AA. We then discuss the advantages and challenges of the CSIA-AA approach using published case studies across a range of topics, including trophic position assessment in various ecosystems, reconstruction of ancient human diets, reconstruction of animal migration and environmental variability, and assessment of marine organic matter dynamics with new classification of microbial fractionation patterns. It is clear that the CSIA-AA approach can provide unique insight into the sources, cycling, and trophic modification of organic nitrogen as it flows through systems. However, this approach will be greatly improved through continued exploration into how biochemical, physiological, and ecological mechanisms affect isotopic fractionation of individual AAs. We end this review with a perspective on future work that will promote the evolution of the rapidly growing field of CSIA-AA.},

   abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that synchronous recruitment is due to a shared susceptibility to environmental processes using stock–recruitment residuals for 52 marine fish stocks within three Northeast Pacific large marine ecosystems: the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and California Current. There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year‐classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross‐shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best‐fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmental variables as covariates and there was some consistent response across stocks to these variables. Future research may be able to utilize these across‐stock environmental influences, in conjunction with an understanding of ecological processes important across early life history stages, to improve identification of environmental drivers of recruitment.},

   abstract = {The quality of bone collagen extracts is central to the14C dating and isotope palaeodietary analysis of bone. The intactness and purity of the extracted gelatin (“collagen”) is strongly dependent on the extent of diagenetic degradation, contamination and the type of extraction method. Possible chemical, elemental and isotopic parameters for the assessment of “collagen” quality are discussed. The most important distinction that can be made is the one between contaminated bone (mostly from temperate zones), and bone low in collagen content (mostly from arid and tropical zones). The latter shows more variability in all quality parameters than the former. The natural level of contamination is mostly so low that stable isotopic measurements are not impaired, although14C measurements can be. It is concluded that there is no unequivocal way to detect natural levels of contamination with the discussed parameters, although their use can identify many cases. In low “collagen” bone, the parameters can identify the great majority of problematic samples: although deviations in these parameters do not necessarily mean isotopic alterations, the increased background found in these samples makes most samples unusable.},

   volume = {476},
   pages = {237-249},
   abstract = {While many migratory marine organisms converge at breeding areas, identifying foraging strategies away from these reproductive sites can be challenging. Adult female green turtles regularly migrate thousands of kilometers between nesting and foraging areas, making it difficult to identify foraging habitats that support nesting populations and to understand their feeding strategies. In this study, we use stable isotope analysis to investigate the trophic ecology and spatial distribution of foraging green turtles in the Greater Caribbean. Further, we explore the possibility that adult green turtles, originally considered to be herbivores, may, like their counterparts in the Pacific Ocean, display carnivorous feeding strategies. The wide range of carbon and nitrogen isotope values in bulk epidermis observed in the nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, could indicate that these turtles feed over several trophic levels. Isotopic niches—or the range of δ C and δ N values, which can be used as a proxy for ecological niche—varied among the 5 green turtle foraging aggregations sampled. Similarly, the isotopic composition of the primary producer also varied substantially with geographic location. However, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) indicated that individuals in the nesting population with different bulk δ N values feed at the same trophic position. The combined results suggest that spatial differences in the isotopic composition of seagrass at the base of the food web, rather than differences in turtle foraging strategy, contribute to the isotopic variation in the nesting population. This study improves understanding of the foraging ecology of a highly dispersed and migratory species.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

   title = {Marine Heatwave Stress Test of Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management in the Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod Fishery},
   journal = {Frontiers in Marine Science},
   volume = {7},
   abstract = {In 2014–2016 an unprecedented warming event in the North Pacific Ocean triggered changes in ecosystem of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) impacting fisheries management. The marine heatwave was noteworthy in its geographical extent, depth range, and persistence, with evidence of shifts in species distribution and reduced productivity. In 2017 a groundfish survey indicated that GOA Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) had experienced a 71% decline in abundance from the previous 2015 survey. The GOA Pacific cod fishery supports a $103 million fishery which is 29% of the groundfish harvest value in the GOA. In this paper, we demonstrate that an increase in metabolic demand during this extended marine heatwave as well as a reduced prey supply can explain the decline in GOA Pacific cod biomass. Although increased mortality likely led to the decline in the Pacific cod population, historically low recruitment concurrent with the heatwave portends a slow recovery for the stock and gives a preview of impacts facing this region due to climate change. We evaluate the intersection of climate change with ecosystem-based fisheries management in the context of GOA Pacific cod with a description of the sensitivities of the ecosystem, how the changes in the ecosystem affected the Pacific cod stock, and a description of how the management system in the North Pacific handled this shock. We also provide suggestions on how fisheries management systems could be improved to better contend with the impacts of climate change such as the effects of heatwaves like that experienced in 2014–2016.},

   abstract = {Some of the longest and most comprehensive marine ecosystem monitoring programs were established in the Gulf of Alaska following the environmental disaster of the Exxon Valdez oil spill over 30 years ago. These monitoring programs have been successful in assessing recovery from oil spill impacts, and their continuation decades later has now provided an unparalleled assessment of ecosystem responses to another newly emerging global threat, marine heatwaves. The 2014-2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some cooling, but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting up to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the heatwave. Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH state.},
