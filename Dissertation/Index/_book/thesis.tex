Welcome to the \emph{R Markdown} thesis template. This template is based
on (and in many places copied directly from) the UW LaTeX template, but
hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never
used TeX or LaTeX before. Using \emph{R Markdown} will also allow you to
easily keep track of your analyses in \textbf{R} chunks of code, with
the resulting plots and output included as well. The hope is this
\emph{R Markdown} template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible
research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will
greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your
results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and
you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of
LaTeX in combination with \emph{Markdown} is more consistent than the
output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing,
and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have
never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going
to be at least twice as large and complex as anything you've written
before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with \emph{Markdown}
and \textbf{R} together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be
your reporting style of choice going forward.

\textbf{Why use it?}

\emph{R Markdown} creates a simple and straightforward way to interface
with the beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in \textbf{R} to
work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and
paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX,
\emph{R Markdown} also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it
and to visualize it using \textbf{R} functions, and also to provide the
documentation and commentary on the results of your project. Further, it
allows for \textbf{R} results to be passed inline to the commentary of
your results. You'll see more on this later.

\textbf{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures,
complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance
of their document should use \emph{R Markdown}. Of particular use should
be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of
\emph{Markdown} and its ability to keep track of and easily include
figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references,
table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone
writing a thesis project.

\chapter{Riparian soil nitrogen cycling and isotopic enrichment in
response to a long-term salmon carcass manipulation
experiment}\label{riparian-soil-nitrogen-cycling-and-isotopic-enrichment-in-response-to-a-long-term-salmon-carcass-manipulation-experiment}

1.1 ABSTRACT

Pacific salmon acquire most of their biomass in the ocean before
returning to spawn and die in coastal streams and lakes, thus providing
subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) to freshwater and terrestrial
ecosystems. Recent declines in salmon abundance have raised questions of
whether managers should mitigate for losses of salmon MDN subsidies. To
test the long-term importance of salmon subsidies to riparian ecosystems
we measured soil N cycling in response to a 20-year manipulation where
salmon carcasses were systematically removed from one bank and deposited
on the opposite bank along a 2 km stream in southwestern Alaska. Soil
samples were taken at different distances from the stream bank along
nine paired transects and measured for organic and inorganic nitrogen
concentrations, and nitrogen transformation rates. MDN was measured
using \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N for bulk soils, and
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} and
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} soil pools. Stable isotope
analyses confirmed \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N was
elevated on the salmon enhanced bank compared to the salmon depleted
bank. However, \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N values of
plant-available inorganic nitrogen exceeded the
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of salmon inputs,
highlighting N isotope fractionation in soils that raises significant
methodological issues with standard MDN assessments in riparian systems.
Surprisingly, despite 20 years of salmon supplementation, the presence
of MDN did not cause a long-term increase in soil N availability. This
finding indicates the importance of MDN to ecosystem N biogeochemistry
and riparian vegetation may be overestimated for some systems. Given
that essential nutrients can also be pollutants, we urge more critical
analyses of the role of MDN to inform compensatory mitigation programs
targeting salmon nutrient enhancement.

1.2 INTRODUCTION

Pacific salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus spp.}) migration from marine
environments to freshwater spawning grounds is a textbook case of
cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies, and dozens of studies have
identified the presence of marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) from salmon as
crossing ecosystem boundaries from oceans to freshwaters and into the
terrestrial environment (sensu, (Polis, Power, \& Huxel,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Polis2004}{2004}; Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2003}{2003}; Scott M, Richard T, Mary F,
\& Mark S, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2002}{2002}). Declines in Pacific
salmon populations in many areas, caused by human activities
(overharvest, habitat degradation, dams) (Richard et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gustafson2007}{2007}), and the concern over loss
of MDN to coastal watersheds has made restoration of salmon nutrients a
focal point for many management and mitigation strategies. For example,
in the Columbia River Basin where Pacific salmon populations have
declined, legislation requiring compensatory mitigation has led to
nutrient enhancement programs, on the foundation that habitats have lost
critical nutrients from salmon and therefore augmentation is necessary
to maintain ecosystem function (Collins, Marcarelli, Baxter, \& Wipfli,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Collins2015}{2015}).

Salmon bring nutrients, including phosphorus (P) and other compounds in
addition to nitrogen (N), into freshwater and terrestrial food webs
through two pathways: 1) direct consumption of tissues by predators and
scavengers, and 2) autotrophic or heterotrophic assimilation of
nutrients released as salmon spawn, die, and eventually decay (Scott M
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2002}{2002}). Salmon are enriched in
the heavy isotope of nitrogen (\textsuperscript{15}N) relative to the
light isotope (\textsuperscript{14}N) when compared to terrestrial and
watershed-derived N. This isotopic enrichment has been used to
quantitatively trace the presence of salmon derived nutrients into
watersheds (Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2003}{2003}). For example, the
proportion of N derived from salmon ranges from approximately 30\% --
75\% in fish and aquatic invertebrates (Naiman, Bilby, Schindler, \&
Helfield, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Naiman2002}{2002}), 10 -- 90\% in
piscivorous mammals such as bears, and 20 -- 40\% in piscivorous fishes
near salmon spawning grounds (Bilby, Fransen, \& Bisson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bilby1996}{1996}; Chaloner, Martin, Wipfli,
Ostrom, \& Lamberti, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chaloner2002}{2002};
Claeson, Li, Compton, \& Bisson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Claeson2006}{2006}; Hilderbrand et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hilderbrand1999}{1999}).

The annual return of this predictable and abundant, yet temporally
limited, high quality resource drives the foraging ecology of both
terrestrial and aquatic consumers (Quinn, Helfield, Austin, Hovel, \&
Bunn, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}; Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2013}{2013}). Carcasses and roe are
documented food sources for over 22 species of mammals, birds
({\textbf{???}}), fishes (Scheuerell, Moore, Schindler, \& Harvey,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheuerell2007}{2007}), and invertebrates
({\textbf{???}}; Meehan, Seminet-Reneau, \& Quinn,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meehan2005}{2005}; Winder, Schindler, Moore,
Johnson, \& Palen, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Winder2005}{2005}). Bear
population density, body size, and reproductive output has been
correlated with meat (primarily salmon) consumption, with piscivorous
populations having 55 times higher density than their meat-limited
counterparts (Hilderbrand et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hilderbrand1999}{1999}). In aquatic ecosystems,
salmon carcass abundance has been correlated with elevated growth rates
of invertebrates, and with size, density, and condition factor of
juvenile salmonids ({\textbf{???}}; R. E. Bilby, Fransen, Bisson, \&
Walter, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bilby1998}{1998}; Wipfli, Hudson,
Caouette, \& Chaloner, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wipfli2003}{2003}).

The presence of MDN has been documented in aquatic primary producers,
though its overall ecological importance remains ambiguous. Via this
bottom-up pathway, salmon supply critical limiting nutrients that can
increase primary and/or bacterial productivity, which are subsequently
transferred to consumers and up through the food web (Chaloner et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chaloner2002}{2002}; Holtgrieve \& Schindler,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2011}{2011}; M. S. Wipfli, Hudson, \&
Caouette, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wipfli1998}{1998}). Higher salmon
returns are correlated with MDN signatures in lower trophic levels
including zooplankton and periphyton (Finney,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Finney2000}{2000}; Holtgrieve, Schindler, Gowell,
Ruff, \& Lisi, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2010}{2010}; Kline Jr et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kline1993}{1993}). Both direct ecological
and paleolimnological evidence suggest MDN and P positively influence
primary production in lakes (Moore et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Moore2007}{2007}). For example, commercial
fisheries remove upwards of two-thirds of MDN which would otherwise
enter some freshwater lakes in Alaska, resulting in a 3-fold decline in
algal production (Schindler, Leavitt, Brock, Johnson, \& Quay,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2005}{2005}). In stream ecosystems, the
decomposition of salmon increases dissolved organic and inorganic
nutrients, including highly available forms such as orthophosphate
(PO\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{3-}) and ammonia/ammonium
(NH\textsubscript{3}/NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}). These
nutrients can stimulate epilithon growth (bacteria and algae), though
the magnitude of this response is highly variable, and dependent on
other growth limiting factors such as sunlight and disturbance
(Janetski, Chaloner, Tiegs, \& Lamberti,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Janetski2009}{2009}; Johnston, MacIsaac,
Tschaplinski, \& Hall, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Johnston2004}{2004};
Mitchell \& Lamberti, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mitchell2005}{2005}).

In the terrestrial realm, bottom-up effects of MDN from salmon are also
thought to be ecologically important, though this has been difficult to
demonstrate rigorously. Studies across the range of salmon in North
America have inferred that up to 26\% of foliar N in riparian plants is
marine derived, with foliar N levels often correlating with salmon
abundance and distance from the salmon spawning location (e.g., Hocking
\& Reynolds, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hocking2012}{2012}; Reimchen \& Fox,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reimchen2013}{2013}). While MDN is clearly
present in terrestrial producers, direct evidence of the importance of
MDN for ecosystem function and productivity is much less evident.
Helfield \& Naiman (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Helfield2001}{2001}) measured
tree growth increments in areas with and without salmon and found higher
growth in one species (Sitka spruce) in areas where salmon nutrients
were present, although these findings were later contested on
statistical grounds (Kirchhoff,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kirchoff2003}{2003}). Hocking \& Reynolds
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hocking2012}{2012}) observed decreased
understory plant diversity with increasing salmon abundance, though this
pattern was largely attributed to increased dominance of a single N
tolerant species (salmonberry). Reimchen \& Fox
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reimchen2013}{2013}) suggested that salmon
abundance increased tree growth, but tree ring
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N values were not related to
salmon abundance; other growth limiting factors such as temperature and
location were important covariates. Most recently, Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) examined tree growth
increments in the riparian zone of a small Alaskan stream before and
after a 20-year, \textgreater{} 200,000 kg, salmon carcass manipulation.
In the two decades prior to manipulation, white spruce (\emph{Picea
glauca}) on average grew faster on one bank compared to the other. The
subsequent decades of carcass manipulation enriched the naturally slower
growing side, and were associated with increased growth. However, the
growth effect of the carcasses was smaller than the natural side-to-side
variation, and other important site and landscape factors such as forest
demography, climate, aspect, and water availability were not fully
considered, a common trend in MDN studies of riparian vegetation.

Interpreting the contributions of MDN to terrestrial producers using
stable isotopes is often highly simplified, and does not consider how
variability of N sources and overall N availability may confound
results. MDN analyses apply simple two-source mixing models to infer the
proportion of total N derived from salmon. When applied to terrestrial
vegetation, the terrestrial end-member for the mixing models is
typically determined by sampling the
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of the same species of plant
either laterally away from the stream (where MDN contribution is
expected to be small), upstream of barriers to salmon migration, or in
watersheds without salmon. For the salmon end-member, a single value
equal to the average \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of
salmon (12.62 ± 0.31 per mille for sockeye salmon) is typically used
(S1). Inherent assumptions with these models therefore include: 1)
reference sites are biogeochemically similar to salmon sites and 2) the
isotopic signature of salmon is unchanged in the soils prior to plant
uptake. N cycling in soils is strongly controlled by position in the
landscape and contains a number of chemical reactions which fractionate
N isotopically {[}({\textbf{???}}); Wheeler, Kavanagh, \& Daanen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wheeler2014}{2014}); Figure 1{]}, therefore
these assumptions may not be valid.

Experiments examining the contributions of MDN are often limited by
short timescales, and relatively few experiments investigate changes in
plant-available soil N pools important to plant nutrient uptake and
growth (Collins et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Collins2015}{2015}).
Studies examining spatial and temporal impacts of salmon on soil
inorganic N have identified highly localized responses (effects only
observed \textless{} 30 cm from carcasses) where soil ammonium
(NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}) and nitrate
(NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}) increase for weeks to months
({\textbf{???}}; Gende, Miller, \& Hood,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2007}{2007}; Holtgrieve, Schindler, \&
Jewett, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2009}{2009}) and rarely
consider long-term N retention in the system. Experiments typically
examine the contributions of MDN by nutrient addition not nutrient
removal; however, nutrient removal is important for understanding the
effects of lower numbers of salmon returning to coastal watersheds due
to fishing, habitat reduction, and climate change. In addition, previous
research observed a strong effect of watershed slope on
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N in riparian plants and
attributed this to topography concentrating carcasses near streams
({\textbf{???}}). However, watershed topography also influences soil
water content and N cycling, which affect N isotopes ({\textbf{???}})
and therefore complicates MDN assessments.

To resolve the extent to which salmon carcasses contributed MDN to
plant-available N pools and the long-term ecological response to this
subsidy, we present a second study of the 20-year carcass manipulation
experiment described in Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). While Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) focused on tree growth before
and after the manipulation, the objective of this work was to determine
whether prolonged enhancement and reduction of salmon subsidies altered
long-term soil N cycling, similar to that documented in forests
receiving N fertilizer additions ({\textbf{???}}; Prescott, Corbin, \&
Parkinson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Prescott1992}{1992}; Prescott,
Kishchuk, \& Weetman, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Prescott1995}{1995}). If
long-term changes in N availability due to salmon enhancement or
reduction were observed, compensatory nutrient subsidies may be valuable
for maintaining critical ecosystem functions in riparian areas with
reduced salmon returns. If not, then the addition of nutrients as a
management response to low salmon returns may have unintended negative
consequences (sensu Compton et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Compton2006}{2006}). Specifically, the importance
of MDN to riparian ecosystems was assessed by 1) evaluating the presence
of MDN in soils enhanced and depleted in salmon carcasses through bulk
stable isotope analysis of N, 2) quantifying the response of
plant-available N pools ({[}NH\textasciitilde{}4\textsuperscript{+}{]}
and {[}NO\textasciitilde{}3\textsuperscript{-}{]}) and their rate of
supply via mineralization and nitrification, 3) considering how
fractionation in soils may impact mixing model results by measuring
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of
NH\textasciitilde{}4\textsuperscript{+} and 4) comparing these results
to the vegetation responses measured by Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) at the same site. This
research fills key knowledge gaps by examining the long-term legacy of
inorganic N pools, both salmon addition and removal, and considering
site variability that may impact the assumption of biogeochemical
similarity between test and control sites, following a 20-year
manipulation.

\section{Math}\label{math}

\TeX~is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed
\TeX~when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to
finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature
of \emph{R Markdown} is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want
to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're
not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.

\section{Chemistry 101: Symbols}\label{chemistry-101-symbols}

Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around
math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{formula\ here\}\$}, with your formula
inside the curly brackets. (Notice the use of the backticks here which
enclose text that acts as code.)

So, \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}\) is written
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Fe\_2\^{}\{2+\}Cr\_2O\_4\}\$}.

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: \(\mathrm{O^-}\)

\noindent Subscript: \(\mathrm{CH_4}\)

To stack numbers or letters as in \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}\), the subscript
is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.

\noindent Bullet: CuCl \(\bullet\) \(\mathrm{7H_{2}O}\)

\noindent Delta: \(\Delta\)

\noindent Reaction Arrows: \(\longrightarrow\) or
\(\xrightarrow{solution}\)

\noindent Resonance Arrows: \(\leftrightarrow\)

\noindent Reversible Reaction Arrows: \(\rightleftharpoons\)

\subsection{Typesetting reactions}\label{typesetting-reactions}

You may wish to put your reaction in an equation environment, which
means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and will number
the equations for you.
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6  + 6O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O}
  \label{eq:reaction}

\section{Biology}\label{biology}

You will probably find the resources at
\url{http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html} helpful, particularly
the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in
TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting
(\url{http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html}). Be sure to
read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables.

\hypertarget{ref-labels}{\chapter{Tables, Graphics, References, and
Labels}\label{ref-labels}}

\hypertarget{tables}{\section{Tables}\label{tables}}

By far the easiest way to present tables in your thesis is to store the
contents of the table in a CSV or Excel file, then read that file in to
your R Markdown document as a data frame. Then you can style the table
with the \texttt{kable} function, or functions in the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/index.html}{kableExtra}
pacakge.

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a
data frame in \textbf{R} that you saw in {[}R Markdown Basics{]} using
the \texttt{kable} function, you can also create tables using
\emph{pandoc}. (More information is available at
\url{http://pandoc.org/README.html\#tables}.) This might be useful if
you don't have values specifically stored in \textbf{R}, but you'd like
to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful
attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows
and columns. Generally I don't recommend this approach of typing the
table directly into your R Markdown document.
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:inher} Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents

\end{longtable}
We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table
\ref{tab:inher}. If you go back to {[}Loading and exploring data{]} and
look at the \texttt{kable} table, we can create a reference to this max
delays table too: Table \ref{tab:maxdelays}. The addition of the
\texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:inher)} option to the end of the table
caption allows us to then make a reference to Table
\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:label)}. Note that this reference could
appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.

\section{Figures}\label{figures}

If your thesis has a lot of figures, \emph{R Markdown} might behave
better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will
automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll
also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then
reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables
earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and
\emph{R Markdown} will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No
need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into
LaTeX to do this, a couple \textbf{R} functions have been created for
you to assist. You'll see their use below.

In the \textbf{R} chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as
\texttt{uw.png} in our main directory. We then give it the caption of
``UW logo'', the label of ``uwlogo'', and specify that this is a figure.
Make note of the different \textbf{R} chunk options that are given in
the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{path =} \StringTok{"figure/uw.png"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6.25in]{figure/uw} \caption{UW logo}\label{fig:uwlogo}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to the UW logo: Figure \ref{fig:uwlogo}. Note the
use of the \texttt{fig:} code here. By naming the \textbf{R} chunk that
contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in
the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure
via the R chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}.

\clearpage 

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an \textbf{R} plot
and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the
\texttt{flights} dataset from Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}. (Note that we've
shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will
next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by
airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the \texttt{scale}
parameter which is discussed on the next page.
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(carrier) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean_dep_delay =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(dep_delay)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean_dep_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{verbatim}
`summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/delaysboxplot-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:delaysboxplot}Mean Delays by Airline}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:delaysboxplot}.

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at
\url{https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv}.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the \texttt{out.extra} chunk option,
which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by
specifying \texttt{"scale=\ "}. Here we use the mathematical graph
stored in the ``subdivision.pdf'' file.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figure/subdivision} \caption{Subdiv. graph}\label{fig:subd}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:subd}. Note that
\texttt{echo=FALSE} is specified so that the \textbf{R} code is hidden
in the document.

\textbf{More Figure Stuff}

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the
\texttt{out.extra} chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF
version of the book.)
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[angle=180, scale=1.1]{figure/subdivision} \caption{A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down}\label{fig:subd2}
\end{figure}
As another example, here is a reference: Figure \ref{fig:subd2}.

\section{Footnotes and Endnotes}\label{footnotes-and-endnotes}

You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} The
footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes
work in much the same way.

\section{Cross-referencing chapters and
sections}\label{cross-referencing-chapters-and-sections}

The
\href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html}{bookdown
documentation} is an excellent source for learning how to
cross-reference in a bookdown project such as a huskydown document. Here
we only cover the most common uses for a typical thesis. If you want
something more complex or fancy, please refer to the bookdown
documentation and seek help from the developers of that package.

By default, all of your chapter and section headers will get an
auto-generated ID label For example, e.g., \texttt{\#\ Chapter\ 1} will
have an auto-generated ID \texttt{chapter-1}. Note that the ID label is
all lower case, and has no spaces. If you have any kind of punctuation
in your header, such as a colon (:), it will not appear in the ID label.
Then in your text you can reference chapter one in your Rmd file like
this: `as discussed in Chapter
\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(chapter-1)}', which will print as `as
discussed in Chapter 1'

We strongly recommend that you to manually assign ID labels to your
chapter header to make it easy to cross-reference. For example, at the
top of the Rmd file for this chapter, you can see:

\texttt{\#\ Tables,\ Graphics,\ References,\ and\ Labels\ \{\#ref-labels\}}

The \texttt{\{\#ref-labels\}} part of this header is the ID label. It
doesn't show in the output, but is there for us to use for easy
cross-referencing, because it can be short, and we don't need to change
it elsewhere our document when we update the chapter header. We can use
this custom ID label in our Rmd document like this: `as discussed in
Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(ref-labels)}', which will print as
`as discussed in Chapter \ref{ref-labels}'. If you need to show custom
text instead of the chapter number, you use this syntax in your Rmd
document:
\texttt{see\ {[}my\ chapter\ about\ labels{]}(\#ref-labels)\ for\ more\ details}
which will appear as `see \protect\hyperlink{ref-labels}{my chapter
about labels} for more details'

To cross-reference a specific section in the same chapter, we recommend
adding a custom ID label to the section header, and using that to
cross-reference. For example, earlier in this chapter we have a section
on tables and in the Rmd file we see
\texttt{\#\#\ Tables\ \{\#tables\}}. We can cross-reference that in the
text like this `as discussed in the section on
\texttt{{[}tables{]}(\#tables)}' which will appear as `as discussed in
the above section on \protect\hyperlink{tables}{tables}'

To cross-reference a section in a different chapter we can use the ID
label from that section directly. For example, we can write in our Rmd
document
\texttt{as\ discussed\ in\ the\ section\ on\ {[}R\ code\ chunks{]}(\#r-chunks)\ in\ Chapter\ \textbackslash{}@ref(rmd-basics)}
which will appear as `as discussed in the section on
\protect\hyperlink{r-chunks}{R code chunks} in Chapter
\ref{rmd-basics}'.

If you prefer to cross-reference by the section number, we can use
custom ID labels in our Rmd document. For example, to refer to a section
in our first chapter, we can write in the Rmd document:
\texttt{as\ discussed\ in\ section\ \textbackslash{}@ref(r-chunks)\ in\ Chapter\ \textbackslash{}@ref(rmd-basics)}.
This will appear with section and chapter numbers like so: as `as
discussed in section \ref{r-chunks} in Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}'.

\section{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for
creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In
addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the
free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. Some Zotero documentation is at
\url{http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero}. In addition, a tutorial
is available from Middlebury College at
\url{http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/}.

\emph{R Markdown} uses \emph{pandoc} (\url{http://pandoc.org/}) to build
its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do
a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To
cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography
database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede
it by the ``at'' symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about
worrying: ({\textbf{???}}). This \texttt{Molina1994} entry appears in a
file called \texttt{thesis.bib} in the \texttt{bib} folder. This
bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You
can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header
in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the \texttt{bib}
folder.

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see
(\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{({\textbf{???}})}.
There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex} (which talks about
using BibTeX, at \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),
\emph{bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style
that best suits your needs, at
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and
\emph{bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by
hand, without BibTeX, at
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html}). The last page
will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can
see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the
appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style
files at \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}. Make sure to download the
file into the csl folder.

\textbf{Tips for Bibliographies}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your
  bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better.
\item
  The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other
  entries.
\item
  When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate
  each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.
  \texttt{Author\ =\ \{Noble,\ Sam\ and\ Youngberg,\ Jessica\},}.
\item
  Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager)
  accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as
  necessary.
\item
  To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is
  generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
\end{itemize}
\section{Anything else?}\label{anything-else}

If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please

(email \href{mailto:bmarwick@uw.edu}{\nolinkurl{bmarwick@uw.edu}}) with
your suggestions. We love to see people using \emph{R Markdown} for
their theses, and are happy to help.

\chapter*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can
add the \texttt{\{-\}} attribute.

\textbf{More info}

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
an indent there.
